   -L str     Template search directory list
				- may appear multiple times
   -T str     Override template file
				- may not be preset
   -l str     Library template file
				- may appear multiple times
   -b str     Base name for output file(s)
				- may not be preset
   -S str     Scheme code file to load
   -F str     Load scheme function library
   -s str     Omit the file with this suffix
				- prohibits these options:
				select-suffix
				- may not be preset
				- may appear multiple times
   -o [arg]   specify this output suffix
				- may not be preset
				- may appear multiple times
   -m         Do not use in-mem streams

The following options are often useful while debugging new templates:

   -t num     Time limit for server shell
				- It must be in the range:
				  0 to 3600
       --- show-defs      This option has been disabled

These options can be used to control what gets processed
in the definitions files and template files.

   -D str     name to add to definition list
				- may appear multiple times
   -U str     definition list removal pattern
				- an alternate for define

These options can be used to automate dependency tracking.

   -M [arg]   emit make dependency file
				- may not be preset
				- may appear multiple times
   -C         Leave a core dump on a failure exit

version and help options:

   -R str     Reset an option's state
   -v [arg]   Output version information and exit
   -h         Display extended usage information and exit
   -!         Extended usage information passed thru pager
   -u         Abbreviated usage to stdout
   -S [arg]   Save the option state to a config file
   -P str     Load options from a config file
				- disabled as --no-load-opts
				- may appear multiple times

The next option supports vendor supported extra options:

   -W str     vendor supported additional options
				These additional options are:
      definitions=str  Definitions input file
				- disabled as --no-definitions
				- enabled by default
				- may not be preset
      source-time      set mod times to latest source
				- disabled as --no-source-time
      equate=str       characters considered equivalent
      writable         Allow output files to be writable
				- disabled as --not-writable
      loop-limit=num   Limit on increment loops
				- is scalable with a suffix: k/K/m/M/g/G/t/T
				- It must lie in one of the ranges:
				  -1 exactly, or
				  1 to 16777216
      shell=str        name or path name of shell to use
      trace=KWd        tracing level of detail
      trace-out=str    tracing output file or filter
      used-defines     Show the definitions used
				- may not be preset


${testname} creates text files from templates using external definitions.

The following option preset mechanisms are supported:
 - reading file \$HOME/.${testname}rc
 - reading file ./.${testname}rc
 - examining environment variables named `
    echo ${testname} | tr 'a-z' 'A-Z'`_*

The valid "trace" option keywords are:
  nothing       debug-message server-shell  templates     block-macros
  expressions   everything
  or an integer from 0 through 6

${testname} is a tool designed for generating program files that contain
repetitive text with varied substitutions.
