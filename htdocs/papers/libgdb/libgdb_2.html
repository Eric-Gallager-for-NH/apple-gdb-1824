<P>
To understand libgdb, it is necessary to understand how the library is
structured.  Historically, GDB is written as a small interpreter for a
simple command language.  The commands of the language perform useful
debugging functions.


<P>
Libgdb is built from GDB by turning the interpreter into a debugging
server.  The server reads debugging commands from any source and
interprets them, directing the output arbitrarily.


<P>
In addition to changing GDB from a tty-based program to a server, a
number of new GDB commands have been added to make the server more
useful for a program with a graphic interface.


<P>
Finally, libgdb includes provisions for asynchronous processing within
the application.


<P>
Most operations that can be carried out with libgdb involve the GDB
command interpreter.  The usual mode of operation is that the operation
is expressed as a string of GDB commands, which the interpreter is then
invoked to carry out.  The output from commands executed in this manner
can be redirected in a variety of useful ways for further processing by
the application.


<P>
The command interpreter provides an extensive system of hooks so an
application can monitor any aspect of the debugging library's state.  An
application can set its own breakpoints and attach commands and
conditions to those.  It is possible to attach hooks to any debugger
command; the hooks are invoked whenever that command is about to be
invoked.  By means of these, the displays of a graphical interface can
be kept fully up to date at all times.


<P>
We show you how to define new primitives in the command language.  By
defining new primitives and using them in breakpoint scripts and command
hooks, an application can schedule the execution of arbitrary C-code at
almost any point of interest in the operation of libgdb.


<P>
We show you how to define new GDB convenience variables for which your
code computes a value on demand.  Referring to such variables in a
breakpoint condition is a convenient way to conditionalize breakpoints
in novel ways.


<P>
To summarize: in libgdb, the gdb command language is turned into a
debugging server.  The server takes commands as input, and the server's
output is redirectable.  An application uses libgdb by formatting
debugging commands and invoking the interpreter.  The application might
maintain breakpoints, watchpoints and many kinds of hooks.  An application
can define new primitives for the interpreter.
