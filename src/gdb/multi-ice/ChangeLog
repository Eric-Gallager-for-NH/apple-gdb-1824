	* remote-utils.c (prepare_resume_reply): Remove unused function.

	* rdi150-low.c (low_thread_op): New function - split from actual

	* server-main.c : 
	* server.h: 	
	* rdi150-low.c: Add "--target-driver" to let driver name be given
	on command line instead of requiring "--config-dialog".  There is,
	however, confusion about what the actual 'tag' names are.

1999-11-02  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@cygnus.co.uk>

	* server-main.c: Fix problem with <null> thread information.  This
	happened because the registers for the "current" thread are not
	accessible on the board, but only available to the ICE environment.

1999-11-01  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@cygnus.co.uk>

	* server-main.c (handle_general_query): Need to pass 'qPxxx' on to
	board to get thread details.  Also 'qC' (current thread) query.

	* remote-utils.c (check_for_SIGIO): Don't try if no connection (fixes
	segmentation violation when Multi-ICE doesn't connect properly).

1999-10-29  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@cygnus.co.uk>

	* server-main.c (handle_resume): Forget 'selected' thread after
	starting execution (continue, step).  Only print 'Executing'/'Stopped' 
	messages if --debug was specified.

	* rdi150-low.c: Change to get read/write of CPSR register to work.

	* server-main.c: Add/complete support for remote thread functions.
	Add support for watchpoints.

	* remote-utils.c: Rework SIGIO support using 'yield()', since
	SIGIO doesn't work well on Cygwin.

	* rdi150-low.c (yield_func): New function - used to regain control
	while executing on target - required in order to abort execution.
	Add support for remote thread functions and watchpoints.

	* low.h: Update/add for new thread support.
