<H1><A NAME="SEC2">Review of previous work</A></H1>



<H2><A NAME="SEC3">DDD (and xgdb, xxgdb, mxgdb, ...)</A></H2>

<P>
Each of these debug GUI interfaces are implemented using an identical
technique.  GDB (or some other debugger) is started as a separate server
process, debug commands are sent to that process and all output is then
parsed.  Of these, DDD is probably the most successful.


<P>
Unfortunately this technique has several limitations:



<UL>
<LI>

it is very sensitive to changes in GDB's output
<LI>

performance is restricted by the speed of communication of between the
GUI and GDB
<LI>

it was difficult to keep the GUI consistent with the CLI
</UL>



<H2><A NAME="SEC4">Insight (a.k.a. GDBtk)</A></H2>

<P>
The initial GDBtk implementation was very like DDD except that it was
embedded in the same process as the debugger.  Commands would be sent to
GDB and the resultant output would then be parsed.  As GDBtk evolved,
and bottle-necks were identified, more direct calls into GDB's internals
have been implemented (ex the assembler window).


<P>
Limitations of GDBtk can be identified:



<UL>
<LI>

the need to share an event loop with GDB
<BR>
With the introduction of an event loop and the asynchronous in GDB it
will finally becoming possible to address this issue.
<LI>

As with DDD GDBtk was often affected by changes to GDB's output
<BR>
The recently introduced gdb-file object should provide significant help.
</UL>



<H2><A NAME="SEC5">EMACS/annotate</A></H2>

<P>
GDB can produce annotated text output through the <CODE>set annotate</CODE>
command.  In addition to the normal text, GDB includes numeric markers
that identify key output tokens (a line number, a file name).  EMACS
parses the annotations and makes use of that information.


<P>
The one key failing of this annotate mode is that the output fields are
identified numerically instead of symbolically as found things like XML.


<P>
While the annotate code is not being actively developed it does have a
significant installed base and consequently needs to be maintained.




<H2><A NAME="SEC6">libgdb 1.0</A></H2>

<P>
libgdb 1.0 was an interesting learning experience.  Much of that
experience is being transfered to libGDB.  Issues that libgdb didn't
address were:



<UL>
<LI>

an event model and a notify mechanism
<LI>

the assumption that reasonable performance could be achieved while
relying purely on a textual interface.
</UL>
