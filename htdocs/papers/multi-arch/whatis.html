<p>Hello,

<p>In the below I'll try to describe, in broad terms, the concept of a
multi-arch debugger and then outline the approach that GDB is taking
in achieving that goal.


<h3>What is an architecture?</h3>

<p>For GDB, an architecture is a very loose concept.  It can be
thought of as any property of the target that isn't directly dependent
on the current instance of the program being debugged.  The term
``target architecture'' is some times used.

<p>The ``architecture'' would include:

<ul>
<li>The ISA (Instruction Set Architecture)<br>A specific combination
of registers/instructions
<li>Application Binary Interface<br>The use of the ISA to provide a
specific binary interface (stack frame format + register allocation)
</ul>

<p>while preclude the actual value of a given register.


<h3>What is multi-arch?</h3>

<p>Such a phrase is fairly loose in its definition so I'll provide you
with a spectrum of definitions:

<ul>

<li> single architecture debugger:

<br> For the most part this is what GDB is today.  If you want to
debug a MIPS/32 (O32 ABI) binary you build GDB for the MIPS/32.  If
you want to to instead debug a SPARC (or even a MIPS/64 - N64 ABI)
then you need to build a second (and third) debugger.

<li> multiple architecture debugger:

<br> The limitation of a single GDB being restricted to a single
architecture is removed.  A single GDB binary being able to debug any
of a number of architectures for which GDB was built.

<br> You might build GDB with support for both MIPS and SPARC targets.
More typically, however, you will be building a GDB with support for a
plithera of ISA variants (as with the MIPS case).  A very simple
example is support for both big and little byte ordered variants.

<br> It should be noted that GDB, as it currently stands, does support
ISA/ABI variants (to a very limited degree).  I'm sure that anyone
that has hacked on that code will agree that, at present, it isn't
pretty ...

<br> Of the possibilities, this has the greatest benefit

<li> simultaneous multi-architecture debugger:

<br> This would have to be the holy grail of debugger technology :-)

<br> (As Stan once mentioned) Increasingly, in the embedded space,
people are developing systems that are built from several different
architectures.  (To pluck an example out of a hat - the next
generation PlayStation has been described as having a 128-bit main
processor as well as a number of co-processors).

Entertainment Inc's Next Generation Playstation</a>, 29 Mar 1999.

<br> On the UNIX side, this is still a very applicable idea - instead
of multiple processors, multiple processes, each running a different
ABI variant.

</ul>


<h3>GDB?</h3>

<p> The objective, at this stage, is to modify GDB so that it can be
built `multi-arch'.

<p> In simple terms, the change required is for all those macro's in
gdb/config/*/tm-*.h to be replaced with corresponding functions.
Those functions combined into a table (very large architecture object
- gdbarch) - one object per architecture variant.  When establishing a
debugging session, gdb would select/create/install the architecture
variant that best matched what was being debugged.

<p> Of course, it isn't that simple.  Much of GDB's internal code
needs to be tweaked so that it makes run-time rather than compile time
architecture dependent decisions.

<p> In succeeding e-mails I'll be expanding on this,

<p>enjoy,
<p>Andrew
