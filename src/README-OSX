Code signing
------------

### Creating a signing identity

See Chapter 2, "Obtaining a Signing Identity" of the Code Signing Guide:

http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/Security/Conceptual/CodeSigningGuide/index.html

Add your certificate to the System keychain. Modify the trust settings
as follows to "Never Trust" for all uses except for code signing, which
should be "Always Trust."

### Signing gdb after building

    codesign -s "Certificate Common Name" dist/bin/*

Cleaning
--------

    make distclean
    find . -iname config.cache -print -delete
