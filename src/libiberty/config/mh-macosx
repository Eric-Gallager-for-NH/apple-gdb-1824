# APPLE LOCAL - The following macro needs to be defined to allow more
# than 256 streams to be open at a time.
# Newer versions of <stdio.h> error out if it is defined with a minimum macOS
# version that is too low, though, so bump it up:

HDEFINES = -D_DARWIN_UNLIMITED_STREAMS -mmacosx-version-min=10.6
