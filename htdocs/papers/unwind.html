<title>Unwinding the stack</title>
</head>
<body>

<p>Various programs (including debuggers, exception handling for both
Ada and C++, and perhaps others) need the ability to be able to unwind
the call stack (that is, return to a calling function - sort of like
setjmp/longjmp but without any "setjmp" step).  To do this, one needs
to know, for example, whether each function has a frame pointer and if
not how deep the stack is.

<p>Here are the various approaches:

<ul>

<li>Parse the function prologues.  This is what GDB does (most of the
time).  Very architecture-dependent, of course, and also limits the
optimizations that the compiler can do and have things continue to
work.

<li>DWARF2 unwind information.  Don't know as much about this.

<li>The <code>.eh_frame</code> section.  The problem with this is that
the unwind information <a

>tends to be large</a> and <a
href="http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc/1998-06/msg00088.html" >cannot be
readonly</a>.
<!-- thread "why isn't the .eh_frame section marked READONLY?" -->

<!-- Can be found at http://www.landfield.com/faqs/g++-FAQ/ but
seems to be pretty far out of date

<p>Also see the section on exceptions in the g++ FAQ
-->

<li>The IA64 defines its own format, as documented in the Itanium
Processor-specific Application Binary Interface (ABI) on <a
href="http://developer.intel.com/design/ia-64/under_lnx.htm" >Intel's
site</a>.

</ul>

<p>Note one somewhat subtle issue: that parsing the prologue works
even if the program counter is within the prologue (GDB simply stops
parsing when it gets to the program counter).  Having the program
counter within the prologue is a more or less normal state of affairs
for optimized code.  Only the fancier (and more space consuming) debug
formats have the ability to say "there is a frame pointer when PC is
0x400 to 0x407, but not when PC is 0x304 to 0x400" and the like.

<p>A couple other issues are: (1) whether compilers are more likely to
emit buggy unwind info than buggy code, and (2) whether unwind info is
in a bizarre (perhaps platform-specific) format, and/or is customarily
manipulated via bizarre platform specific libraries (or even worse,
bizarre libraries with licensing issues).  These don't necessarily
apply to all implementations/formats of unwind info, it is just they
have been problems in the past.
