	prefix used on the first line must also used on any continuation
	lines and will be added in if the result requires another line.

	regex pattern.  If the program name precedes this on the line, it and
	any intervening white space are copied to the output but are otherwise
	ignored.  The text preceding that is the per-line prefix that must
	start each successive copyright line.

	Any supplied regular expression should have at least one
	subexpression, e.g. @samp{([12][90][0-9][0-9])}.  The first character
	of the full match is presumed to be the start of the copyright mark
	and the first non-whitespace character after the subexpression match
	is presumed to be the start of the year list.
