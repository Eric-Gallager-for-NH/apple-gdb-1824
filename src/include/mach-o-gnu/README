This directory has been temporarily renamed from "mach-o" to "mach-o-gnu"
because it was shadowing some system headers, which led to issues.
Specifically, the following headers were shadowing system ones
(using their full include names):
- mach-o/loader.h
- mach-o/reloc.h
Unfortunately this workaround has led to additional issues for files that
include the headers here that do NOT shadow system ones.
Specifically, the following headers have no system equivalents
(using their full include names):
- mach-o/arm.h (closest thing is mach-o/arm/reloc.h)
- mach-o/codesign.h
- mach-o/external.h
- mach-o/unwind.h (closest thing is mach-o/compact_unwind_encoding.h)
- mach-o/x86-64.h (closest thing is mach-o/x86_64/reloc.h)
Even though there are more of these headers, they were introduced to FSF
gdb long after the point where Apple gdb branched off, which is what this
fork is based upon, so moving them aside causes fewer errors than are
caused by having the shadowing ones around. Of course it would make sense
to deal with these headers more granularly, instead of just moving aside
the entire directory, but that can wait for a future commit.
