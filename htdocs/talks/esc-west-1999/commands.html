<h1> Tracing program execution: the record/playback model </h1>
<p>
Some program behaviors can be analyzed only by collecting data over
long periods of time for later analysis.  Other problems occur in
sections of code that are too time-sensative to be debugged
interactively.  In these cases, tracing may be more appropriate than
breakpoint debugging.
<p>
This section discusses the following topics.

<h2><a name="intro">       Tracepoints and trace experiments </a> </h2>
<p>
Like a breakpoint, a tracepoint makes your program stop whenever a
certain point in the program is reached.  However, while a breakpoint
stops the program for a "long" time (while GDB prompts you and lets
you type commands), a tracepoint stops the program for only a "short"
time, after which the program gets to continue with minimal disruption
of its behavior.  During this "short" interval, the trace mechanism
records the fact that it has been there (ie. that the tracepoint was
executed), and may also perform certain actions that you've requested
such as recording the values of selected variables and registers.
Thus it's not well defined how long a "short" time is, but in any
event it will be thousands of times shorter than the time required for
a human to do the same tasks interactively.
<p>
As with breakpoints, GDB assigns a number to each tracepoint when you
create it.  Like breakpoint numbers, tracepoint numbers are successive
integers starting from one.  Many of the commands associated with
tracepoints use the tracepoint number to identify which tracepoint to
delete, disable, etc.
<p>
A trace experiment must involve each of the following steps: defining
the tracepoints and actions, running the experiment, and reviewing the
results.  Many of the commands defined below (such as setting and
deleting tracepoints) have no real effect until you actually begin
running the trace experiment.  Moreover, many of them <b>also</b> have
no effect <b>during</b> an already running trace experiment.  Once a
trace experiment is running, changing the tracepoints or their
attributes will have no effect unles you stop the experiment and start
it again.
<p>
<h2><a name="tracepoints"> Setting tracepoints </a></h2>
<p>
Tracepoints are set with the <b>trace</b> command (abbreviated
<b>tr</b>).  The debugger convenience variable <b>'$tpnum'</b> records
the tracepoint number of the most recently set tracepoint; see <a
href=#convenience>Convenience Variables</a> for a discussion of what
you can do with convenience variables.
<p>
The location of a tracepoint can be specified in exactly the same ways
as the location of a breakpoint, here reproduced for convenience.
<p>
<h3>trace <b>func_name</b> </h3>
Set a tracepoint at entry to function <b>func_name</b>.  When using
source languages that permit overloading of symbols, such as C++,
<b>func_name</b> may refer to more than one possible place to trace.  See
<a href=#menus>Tracepoint menus</a> for a discussion of that situation.

<h3> trace <b> +offset </b></h3>
<h3> trace <b> -offset </b></h3>
Set a tracepoint some number of lines forward or back from the
"current location".  Note that the "current location" is affected not
only by stack walking commands such as <b>up</b> and <b>down</b>, but
also by trace browsing commands such as <b>tfind</b> 
(see <a href=#tfind>Reviewing trace results</a>).

<h3> trace <b> linenum </b></h3>
Set a tracepoint at line <b>linenum</b> in the current source file.  The
current source file is the last file listed, or the last file in which
execution stopped (eg. at a breakpoint), or the last file visited
while browsing trace results (see <a href=#tfind>Reviewing trace results</a>).

<h3> trace <b> filename:linenum </b></h3>
Set a tracepoint at line <b>linenum</b> in source file <b>filename</b>.

<h3> trace <b>filename:func_name </b></h3>
Set a tracepoint at entry to function <b>func_name</b> found in file
<b>filename</b>.  The filename is superfluous except when several source
files contain functions with the same name.

<h3> trace <b>*address </b></h3>
Set a tracepoint at address <b>address</b>.  You can use this to set
tracepoints in parts of your program which do not have debugging
information or source files.
<p>

<h2><a name="menus">       Tracepoint menus </a></h2>
Some programming languages (notably C++) permit a single function name
to be defined several times, for application in different contexts.
This is called <b>overloading</b>.  Tracepoints on overloaded functions
behave exactly like breakpoints do (see "Breakpoint menus" in the GDB
manual (available at <a href=http://sourceware.cygnus.com/gdb>http://sourceware.cygnus.com/gdb</a>)).

<h2><a name="delete">      Deleting tracepoints </a></h2>
Any tracepoint's definition can be permanently discarded using the
<b>delete tracepoint</b> command (abbreviated <b>del tr</b>).  Give
the tracepoint number(s) of the tracepoint(s) that you want to
delete.  A deleted tracepoint no longer exists, in contrast with a 
disabled tracepoint (which can be re-enabled).  Use the <b>info
tracepoints</b> command to discover the numbers of your tracepoints.
<p>
<b>NOTE: </b>this command has no effect on a running trace experiment.  

<h3> delete tracepoint <b>[tpnums...] </b></h3>
Delete the tracepoint(s) of the numbers specified as arguments.  If no
argument is specified, delete all tracepoints (GDB asks confirmation,
unles you have <b>set confirm off</b>.  You can abbreviate this
command as <b>del tr</b>.

<h2><a name="disable">     Disabling tracepoints </a></h2>
Rather than deleting a tracepoint, you might prefer to <b>disable</b>
it.  This will make the tracepoint inoperative in the next trace
experiment, but remembers the tracepoint and all it's attributes so
that you can <b>enable</b> it again.  You disable and enable tracepoints
with the <b>disable tracepoint</b> and <b>enable tracepoint</b>
commands.  Use the <b>info tracepoints</b> command to find out the
numbers of tracepoints and which ones are enabled.
<p>
<b>NOTE: </b>these commands have no effect on a running trace experiment.

<h3> disable tracepoint <b>[tpnums...] </b></h3>
Disable the specified tracepoints -- or all tracepoints if none are
listed.  A disabled tracepoint will have no effect in the next trace
experiment, but is not forgotten.  All its attributes are remembered,
and will still be in effect if it is enabled again later.  You can
abbrevkate this command as <b>dis tr</b>.

<h3> enable tracepoint <b>[tpnums...] </b></h3>
Enable the specified tracepoints (or all tracepoints).  They will
become effective again the next time a trace experiment is started.
You can abbreviate this command as <b>en tr</b>.

<h2><a name="passcount">   Tracepoint passcounts </a></h2>
Passcounts allow you to terminate a trace experiment automatically.
If a tracepoint has a non-zero passcount of <n>, then the trace
experiment will automatically terminate (and no more trace data will
be collected) when that tracepoint has been executed <n> times.
<p>
Any number of tracepoints may have passcounts of any integer value.
When the first tracepoint reaches its passcount, the trace experiment
will terminate.
<p>
To clear a passcount, set it to zero.
<p>
<b>NOTE: </b>this command has no effect on a running trace experiment.

<h3> passcount <b> &ltn&gt [tpnum] </b> </h3>
Set the passcount of the given tracepoint to &ltn&gt.  If tpnum is
omitted, set the passcount of the most recently defined tracepoint.
You can abbreviate this command as <b>pas</b>.

<h2><a name="action">      Tracepoint action lists </a></h2>
A tracepoint can do <b>far</b> more than simply record where your
program has been.  It can also save the values of selected program
variables, machine registers, or memory locations for you to examine
later at your leisure.  All of these data go into a single buffer, but
except for the size of that buffer there is virtually no limit to the
data you can collect at tracepoints.
<p>
The actions at a tracepoint may also include single-stepping for some
number of machine instructions, collecting data at each step.  In this
mode you can collect the changes in registers or variables over a
range of instructions.
<p>
Here are the commands for defining the actions for a tracepoint.

<h3> actions <b> [tpnum] </b> </h3>
...action-list...
<p>
end
<p>
Specify a list of actions for tracepoint number <b>tpnum</b>.  The
actions themselves appear on the following lines.  Type a line
containing just <b>end</b> to terminate the actions.  To remove all
actions from a tracepoint, type <b>actions [tpnum]</b> and follow it
immediately with <b>end</b>; that is, give no actions.  With no
<b>tpnum</b> argument, <b>actions</b> refers to the last tracepoint set.

<h3> collect <b> [exprs] </b> </h3>
Describes data to be collected at the tracepoint.  <b>Exprs</b> may be
any legal C expression, or several expressions separated by commas.
Any global, static, or local variables may be collected.
In addition, the following special arguments are supported.
<ul>
<li>	$regs	- collect all machine registers
<li>	$args	- collect all arguments of the traced function
<li>	$locs	- collect all local variables of the traced function
</ul>
<h3> while-stepping <b>&ltn&gt</b> </h3>
<pre>
	while-stepping &ltn&gt
	  collect [exprs]
	end
</pre>
<p>
After collecting any data requested at the tracepoint itself,
execute &ltn&gt machine instructions, collecting the following expressions
after each instruction.  Each step will generate a separate trace
event in the trace buffer (see <a href=#tfind>Reviewing trace results</a>).

<h3>end</h3>
Terminates an action list, or a while-stepping collection list.
If actions include stepping, two <b>end</b> commands are required.
<p>
<b>NOTE: </b>these commands have no effect on a running trace experiment.

<h2><a name="info">        Listing tracepoints </a></h2>

Use this command to list all existing tracepoints and their
attributes.

<h3> info tracepoints <b>[tpnum] </b> </h3>
Print a list of all tracepoints that have been set and not deleted,
together with the following information for each tracepoint.
<ul>
<li> Tracepoint Number
<li> Enabled or Disabled
  <ul>
  <li>	Enabled tracepoints are marked with a 'y'; disabled
	tracepoints display 'n'.
  </ul>
<li> Address
  <ul>
  <li>	The memory address in your program of the tracepoint.
  </ul>
<li> PassCount
  <ul>
  <li>	If non-zero, the trace experiment will be terminated when 
	this tracepoint has been hit this many times.
  </ul>
<li> StepCount
  <ul>
  <li>	If non-zero, the tracepoint will also execute this many
	machine instructions, collecting a trace event for each one.
  </ul>
<li> What
  <ul>
  <li>	Source file and line number of the tracepoint, if known.
  </ul>
<li> Actions
  <ul>
  <li>	Repeats the actions list for the tracepoint, as entered
	by the user.
  </ul>
</ul>

<h2><a name="start">       Starting and stopping trace collection </a></h2>

None of the commands discussed so far will have any actual effect
until you tell GDB to start a trace experiment.  Only then will the
tracepoints begin collecting data.  Moreover, once you have started a
trace experiment, none of the commands above have any effect on the
running experiment.  Changes to your tracepoints will only go into
effect the <b>next</b> time you start a trace experiment.  Therefore, if
you delete, disable, enable, or define any new tracepoints, or change
the actions or passcounts of existing tracepoints, you must stop any
currently running trace collection experiment and start a new one
before your changes will go into effect.  
<p>
You start and stop trace collection by using the <b>tstart</b> and
<b>tstop</b> commands.

<h3> tstart </h3>
Start trace data collection.

<h3> tstop </h3>
Stop trace data collection.
<p>
<b>NOTE: </b>trace data collection may also be stopped automatically if any
tracepoint's passcount is reached.  It may also stop automatically if
the trace buffer becomes full, unles the trace buffer is set to
operate in a continuous "circular buffer" mode.
<p>
Note also that starting trace collection has the side effect of
discarding any old trace data in the buffer, so that the buffer starts
out empty each time.  You may stop a trace experiment and still look
at your saved data, but as soon as you start a new trace experiment,
the previously collected data will be irretrievably gone.

<h2><a name="tfind">       Reviewing trace results </a></h2>

While a trace experiment is running, every time a tracepoint is
executed generates a <b>trace event</b>, and every trace event generates
a data record called a <b>trace frame</b> in a buffer called the
<b>trace buffer</b>.  If a tracepoint's actions include single-stepping,
each single-step also generates a trace event and a trace frame.
<p>
Each trace frame has a sequential identifying number starting from
zero, plus the address (PC) of the event.  In addition, the trace
frame contains any values collected by the actions for the 
corresponding tracepoint.
<p>

The basic commands for selecting a trace frame and extracting data
from it are <b>tfind</b> and <b>tdump</b>.  In addition, several
built-in GDB variables are provided for identifying the currently
selected trace frame.

<h3> tfind <b>[&lt event id &gt | start | none | -]</b> </h3>
Select a trace frame (event) by id number.  <b>"tfind start"</b> is a synonym
for <b>tfind 0</b> (where zero is the lowest numbered trace frame).
If no argument is specified, selects the next frame.  <b>"tfind -"</b>
selects the previous frame, and <b>"tfind none"</b> selects no frame.

<h3>tfind tracepoint <b>[&lt tracepoint id &gt] </b> </h3>
Select the next trace frame (event) corresponding to the given tracepoint.  If
no argument is given, find the next trace frame corresponding to the
same tracepoint as the current frame.

<h3>tfind pc <b>[&lt address &gt]</b> </h3>
Select the next trace frame corresponding to the given code address.
If no argument is given, find the next trace frame corresponding to
the same PC as the current frame.

<h3>tfind line <b>[linenum]</b> </h3>
<h3>tfind line <b>[filename:linenum]</b> </h3>
Select the next trace frame corresponding to the given source line.
If no argument is given, then advance to the next trace frame from any
source line <b>other than</b> the current one.  This is useful when a
trace frame is collected for every machine instruction.  It has the
effect of advancing past all the events for instructions in the
current source line, thus getting to the next line traced.

<h3>tdump</h3>
Print all of the data collected at the current trace frame.  

<h3><a name=convenience> Convenience variables</h3>
<ul>
<li>$trace_frame 
  <ul>
  <li> the ID of the currently selected frame 
       (or -1 if no trace frame is selected).
  </ul>
<li>$tracepoint  
  <ul>
  <li> the ID of the tracepoint corresponding to $trace_frame
  </ul>
<li>$trace_line  
  <ul>
  <li> the source line number corresponding to $tracepoint
  </ul>
<li>$trace_file  
  <ul>
  <li> the source filename  corresponding to $tracepoint
  </ul>
<li>$trace_func  
  <ul>
  <li> the name of the function containing $tracepoint
  </ul>
</ul>
<p>
By using combinations of the above commands and convenience variables,
together with GDB's built-in scripting language, there are many
options for viewing the collected trace data.  The most
straightforward (but not necessarily the most useful) would be to
simply print out everything that was collected.
<pre>
	(gdb) tfind start
	(gdb) while ($trace_frame != -1)
	> tdump
	> tfind
	> end
</pre>
There are many ways to filter and format the data.  As a simple
example, you might want to extract only the data for certain
tracepoints. 
<p>
	(gdb) tfind start
	(gdb) while ($trace_frame != -1)
	> if ($tracepoint == 2 || $tracepoint == 7)
	  > tdump
	  > end
	> tfind
	> end
<p>
Whenever a trace frame is selected, all of GDB's existing commands for
examining machine state and data will get their values from the trace
frame.  Therefore you can use commands such as GDB's <b>printf</b>
command to format the collected trace data any way you like (so long
as you only attempt to print data that you've collected!).  For
example, you might want to produce a verbose listing of certain values
from each of several tracepoints.
<pre>
	(gdb) tfind start
	(gdb) while ($trace_frame != -1)
	> printf "Tracepoint %d, ", $tracepoint
	> printf "line %d, ", $trace_line
	> if ($tracepoint == 1)
	  > printf "x == %d\n", x
	  > end
	> if ($tracepoint == 2)
	  > printf "gradient == %d, ", gradient
	  > printf "register D0 == 0x%x\n", $d0
	  > end
	> if ($tracepoint == 3)
	  > printf "z / q == %f\n", z / q
	  > end
	> tfind
	> end
</pre>
However, many people find that the most useful way to review the
collected data is interactively.  Whenever you use the <b>tfind</b>
command, GDB displays the source line corresponding to the selected
trace frame, just as if you had stepped to that line or hit a
breakpoint there.  The next tfind command takes you to the next source
line, very much like stepping.  At each trace frame, you can use all
of the customary GDB commands to examine the data collected, very much
as you could if you were sitting at a breakpoint, except that you can
only examine values that you collected earlier by listing them in the
action lists of your tracepoints.  
<p>
In fact, if you plan ahead and collect a chunk of memory from the
machine stack, you can even use GDB's <b>backtrace</b> or <b>up</b>
and <b>down</b> commands to find out what functions called the
function that you're tracing.
<pre>
	(gdb) trace foo
	(gdb) actions
	> collect $fp, *(long **) $sp @ 64
	> end
</pre>
<h2><a name="save">        Saving tracepoint definitions </a></h2>

Once you have defined a set of tracepoints and actions, you may want
to save them to be used later in another debug session.  The
<b>save-trace</b> command saves all tracepoints, passcounts and
actions as a GDB command file, which can be imported later by using
the <b>source</b> command (See "Command files" in the GDB
manual (available at <a href=http://sourceware.cygnus.com/gdb>http://sourceware.cygnus.com/gdb</a>)).


<h3> save-tracepoints <b> filename</b> </h3>
Write all tracepoint definitions, passcounts, and actions out to the
command file <b>'filename'</b>, suitable for reading with the
<b>source</b> command.
