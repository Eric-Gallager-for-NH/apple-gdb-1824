For rebuilding GDB snapshots, several useful utilities (especially
automake) are available:

	ftp://sourceware.org/pub/gdb/infrastructure/
  and	ftp://sourceware.org/pub/binutils/

The following snapshots are available:

    branch/		Taken from the most recent release
    current/		Taken from the head of GDB's mainline

For each snapshot, the following archives are made available:

    gdb+dejagnu*	Contains GDB and DEJAGNU
    insight+dejagnu*	Containts INSIGHT, DEJAGNU and TCL/TK.
    *.tar.bz2		A bzip2 tar archive
    *.diff.bz2		Differences between two snapshots.

Using 6.0 (previous) and 6.1 (next) as examples, snapshots in the
branch/ are assigned the version numbers:

    6.0.90, ...		Pre 6.1 release snapshots taken from
			the gdb_6_1-branch.
    6.1.0.90, ...	Post 6.1 (pre 6.1.1) release snapshots
			taken from the gdb_6_1-branch.
