<P>
A running libgdb function can take a long time.  Libgdb includes a hook
so that an application can run intermittently during long debugger
operations.


<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Function:</U> void <B>gdb_set_poll_fn</B> <I>(<VAR>fn</VAR>, <VAR>fn_arg</VAR>)</I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX36"></A>

<PRE>
void (*<VAR>fn</VAR>)(void * fn_arg, int (*gdb_poll)());
void * <VAR>fn_arg</VAR>;
</PRE>

<P>
Arrange to call <VAR>fn</VAR> periodically during lengthy debugger operations.
If <VAR>fn</VAR> is NULL, polling is turned off.  <VAR>fn</VAR> should take two
arguments: an opaque pointer passed as <VAR>fn_arg</VAR> to
<CODE>gdb_set_poll_fn</CODE>, and a function pointer.  The function pointer
passed to <VAR>fn</VAR> is provided by libgdb and points to a function that
returns 0 when the poll function should return.  That is, when
<CODE>(*gdb_poll)()</CODE> returns 0, libgdb is ready to continue <VAR>fn</VAR>
should return quickly.


<P>
It is possible that <CODE>(*gdb_poll)()</CODE> will return 0 the first time it
is called, so it is reasonable for an application to do minimal processing
before checking whether to return.


<P>
No libgdb functions should be called from an application's poll function,
with one exception: <CODE>gdb_request_quit</CODE>.
</DL>


<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Function:</U> void <B>gdb_request_quit</B> <I>(void)</I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX37"></A>
This function, if called from a poll function, requests that the
currently executing libgdb command be interrupted as soon as possible,
and that control be returned to the top-level via an error.


<P>
The quit is not immediate.  It will not occur until at least after the
application's poll function returns.
</DL>
