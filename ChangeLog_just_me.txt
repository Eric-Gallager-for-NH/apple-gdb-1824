    try to do some more things to make buildable with the top-level
    makefile

    - make sure more Makefile targets depend on config.status, as we are
    now removing and re-creating config.status-es to trick configure
    scripts when cross-compiling
    - add options to use dmalloc in more things
    - try to deal with different modules having trouble finding the proper
    malloc/realloc functions (this was especially bad with readline, so I
    just copied the malloc.c and realloc.c sources from gnulib into that
    module... I did NOT feel like doing that for all of them though...)
    - add back some files that Apple removed from the distribution but left
    referenced in their Xcode project
    - link libintl against CoreFoundation
    - Try to get binutils to properly link against libintl
    - set same environment variables in the Xcode project as we do in the
    .profile_snowleopard and .profile_leopard files at the top level
    - silence warnings about re-defining LC_MESSAGES
    - make some changes to libiberty's configure script now that regex.c
    has been added back to its source (regex.c still has to be compiled
    separately from the makefile though, with `gcc -c -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -g
    -O2 -I. -I./../include -D_DARWIN_UNLIMITED_STREAMS
    -mmacosx-version-min=10.6 -W -Wall -pedantic -Wwrite-strings
    -Wstrict-prototypes ./regex.c -o regex.o`)
    - some minor reformatting
    - silence some clang-produced warnings for readline
    - symlink src/intl to src/libintl (because that is the whole name
    for it)

    hoo boy, this is going to be a long changelog...

    - gitignore more things
    - make top-level makefile recurse into subdirectories
    - have top-level configure script move itself aside after it runs
    - wrap text more tightly in various files
    - do stuff to try to fix src/Makefile (still not sure whether it
    ultimately ends up getting generated by automake or autogen...)
    - move deprecated "cygnus" Automake option to a separate unused
    variable in various Makefile.am files
    - make a bunch of changes to configure scripts (mostly silencing
    autoscan/autoreconf warnings and stuff)
    - I temporarily broke src/bfd, but managed to fix it again before
    committing...
    - lower -mmacosx-version-min from 10.7 to 10.6 wherever found
    because I am still on Snow Leopard
    - excessively "#ifdef" the includes of files that were giving me
    compilation problems
    - be more apostrophe-phobic
    - chmod certain scripts to be executable
    - get gdbserver to at least compile for i386/x86_64 darwin, via
    gratuitous copying and pasting from the Linux versions of the
    relevant i386 files
    - try to get the Xcode project to work, but that is hopeless...
    - some subdirectories that did not used to use autoheader now do,
    as such some files might be missing an include for "config.h"
    - Add a list of older tarballs that were the last versions to
    contain certain files and directories
    - Add said files from older tarballs
    - Add a readme about the darwinbuild plist (still seeing some
    errors with it)
    - copy in some files from gnulib and other GNU sources
