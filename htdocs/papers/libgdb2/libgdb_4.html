<H1><A NAME="SEC25">Implementation</A></H1>

<P>
This strategy outline the recommended strategy for implementing each of
the components.




<H2><A NAME="SEC26">Query</A></H2>

<P>
The set of possible requests, and their behavour will initially be based
on a subset of the existing CLI command set.  In particular the commands:



<UL>
<LI>

<CODE>show ...</CODE>
<LI>

<CODE>info ...</CODE>
</UL>

<P>
would be used as a starting point.


<P>
Rather than clone those commands, the query methods would be implemented
by modifying the existing code base so that it "builds" each result.
The existing CLI would call the code with a simple text builder
(<TT>`cli-out.[hc]'</TT>?); GUILE would make the same call but with its own
complicated builder (<TT>`guile-out.[hc]'</TT>?).


<P>
As an example of the change required, the function <CODE>breakpoint_1()</CODE>
in <TT>`breakpoint.c'</TT> would be modified from:



<PRE>
annotate_breakpoint (bs-&#62;breakpoint_at-&#62;number);
printf_filtered ("\nBreakpoint %d, ", bs-&#62;breakpoint_at-&#62;number);
</PRE>

<P>
to:



<PRE>
annotate_breakpoint (bs-&#62;breakpoint_at-&#62;number);
ui_out_text (uiout, "\nBreakpoint ");
ui_out_field_int (uiout, "bkptno", bs-&#62;breakpoint_at-&#62;number);
ui_out_text (uiout, ", ");
</PRE>

<P>
A GUILE builder would construct the internal structure:



<PRE>
(..... (bkptno 1) ...)
</PRE>



<H2><A NAME="SEC27">Notify</A></H2>

<P>
The notify mechanism is based on the hook system already provided to
GDBtk.  The mechanism would need to be formalized
(<TT>`gdb-hooks.[hc]'</TT>) (say).


<P>
The set of notify hooks would be expected to evolve over time as the
needs of the clients are better understood.




<H2><A NAME="SEC28">Operations</A></H2>

<P>
The control interface shall be based on GDB's existing set of <CODE>run</CODE>
/ <CODE>stop</CODE> et.al. commands.




<H2><A NAME="SEC29">ui-stream / gdb-file</A></H2>

<P>
The mechanism for capturing output directed to various streams (such as
output from the remote target) is the gdb_file.  Apart from a number of
minor refinements, that mechanism is already in place.


<P>
In the near term, gdb-file should be broken out of <TT>`utils.c'</TT> and
moved to a new file <TT>`ui-stream.[hc]'</TT> (say).




<H2><A NAME="SEC30">event-loop</A></H2>

<P>
The event loop is beyond the scope of this document.




<H2><A NAME="SEC31">Start up</A></H2>

<P>
Although the initialization mechanism used by optional client's is
still undefined, the below outlines one possible sequence:



<OL>
<LI>

The alternative client is linked in with GDB. The top-level code
contained in <TT>`XXX-top.c'</TT>.  This file includes a standard
<VAR>__initialize_XXX</VAR> function.
<LI>

When GDB is started <VAR>--ui=NAME</VAR> is passed as an argument.  GDB saves
NAME in a global variable.
<LI>

Eventually control reaches <VAR>__initialize_XXX</VAR>.  That function checks
to see if it matches <VAR>NAME</VAR> and if it does, registers its custom
version of the main event loop.
<LI>

GDB continues initialization and then, eventually calls <VAR>XXX</VAR>'s
custom event loop.
</OL>
