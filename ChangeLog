	- readline: properly clean up after a shlib build, and stop using

	- src/sim: avoid using -Wuninitialized without optimization

	darn it, I broke stuff again

	- un-gitignore bfd texi files, as they are actually needed as
	dependencies for make targets
	- bfd: make sure bfd.h is present
	- bfd/doc: make sure chew dSYMs get cleaned up
	- bfd/m4/ax_patch_libtool_changing_cmd_ifs.m4: make sure libtool
	exists before trying to move it
	- accidentally deleted some bfd source files... (they might be
	regenerate-able, idk...)
	- work on tcl.m4
	- configure script updates
	- gdb/gnulib got broken somehow wrt <string.h>-related `sed`
	substitutions, try to fix it
	- touch old MPW headers
	- opcodes: I broke something wrt i386-opc.lo, try to fix
	- utils: recurse into "misc" subdir
	- utils/misc/doschk: try to make it safe to include <stdlib.h>
	(for the exit() function) by dealing with mismatched malloc()
	prototype
	- zlib: sometimes the ${AR} gets mismatched with the wrong
	${ARFLAGS}, try to compensate
	- zlib: fix some warnings about implicit function declarations
	- etc: add root-gdb-backtrace.sh script from CERN's ROOT package
	(with some modifications to silence `shellcheck` warnings)
	- add some more texinfo stuff
	- add decomment.tproj and relpath.tproj from bootstrap_cmds to
	utils (with some modifications)
	- zlib: add some files from Apple's zlib fork, such as an
	Apple-specific test suite, and an Xcode project

	probably should have split this up into smaller commits...

	- found Apple's binutils sources, which looks like they were a
	precursor to their gdb sources, so include some old files from them
	(mpw stuff, mostly)
	- also found Apple's separate set of sources for expect, so include
	some files from that, too
	- update configure script for bfd
	- touch old files in src/expect
	- fix some implicit declaration warnings for src/expect by
	including some more headers
	- regenerate src/expect/Dbgconfigure (this is more complicated than
	regenerating your normal autoconf script, because it involves
	renaming stuff)
	- apostrophe-phobia and formatting
	- Make some expect scripts executable
	- Make src/intl's configure script actually generate po2tbl.sed
	- let libiberty link against mmalloc, if desired
	- add src/electric-fence directory

	try to do some more things to make buildable with the top-level makefile

	- make sure more Makefile targets depend on config.status, as we're now
	removing and re-creating config.status-es to trick configure scripts
	when cross-compiling
	- add options to use dmalloc in more things
	- try to deal with different modules having trouble finding the proper
	malloc/realloc functions (this was especially bad with readline, so I
	just copied the malloc.c and realloc.c sources from gnulib into that
	module... I did NOT feel like doing that for all of them though...)
	- add back some files that Apple removed from the distribution but left
	referenced in their Xcode project
	- link libintl against CoreFoundation
	- Try to get binutils to properly link against libintl
	- set same environment variables in the Xcode project as we do in the
	.profile_snowleopard and .profile_leopard files at the top level
	- silence warnings about re-defining LC_MESSAGES
	- make some changes to libiberty's configure script now that regex.c
	has been added back to its source (regex.c still has to be compiled
	separately from the makefile though, with `gcc -c -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -g
	-O2 -I. -I./../include -D_DARWIN_UNLIMITED_STREAMS
	-mmacosx-version-min=10.6 -W -Wall -pedantic -Wwrite-strings
	-Wstrict-prototypes ./regex.c -o regex.o`)

	- silence some clang-produced warnings for readline

	it)

	hoo boy, this is going to be a long changelog...

	- gitignore more things
	- make top-level makefile recurse into subdirectories
	- have top-level configure script move itself aside after it runs
	- wrap text more tightly in various files
	- do stuff to try to fix src/Makefile (still not sure whether it
	ultimately ends up getting generated by automake or autogen...)
	- move deprecated "cygnus" Automake option to a separate unused
	variable in various Makefile.am files
	- make a bunch of changes to configure scripts (mostly silencing
	autoscan/autoreconf warnings and stuff)
	- I temporarily broke src/bfd, but managed to fix it again before
	committing...
	- lower -mmacosx-version-min from 10.7 to 10.6 wherever found because
	I'm still on Snow Leopard
	- excessively "#ifdef" the includes of files that were giving me
	compilation problems
	- be more apostrophe-phobic
	- chmod certain scripts to be executable
	- get gdbserver to at least compile for i386/x86_64 darwin, via
	gratuitous copying and pasting from the Linux versions of the relevant
	i386 files
	- try to get the Xcode project to work, but that's hopeless...
	- some subdirectories that did not used to use autoheader now do, as
	such some files might be missing an include for "config.h"
	- Add a list of older tarballs that were the last versions to contain
	certain files and directories
	- Add said files from older tarballs
	- Add a readme about the darwinbuild plist (still seeing some errors
	with it)
	- copy in some files from gnulib and other GNU sources

2013-09-23  Eric Gallager  <egallager@comcast.net>

	multiple changes

	- wrap lines more tightly
	- be more apostrophe-phobic
	- xmllint doc/ReleaseNotes.xml
	(still more editing to do)

2013-09-23  Eric Gallager  <egallager@comcast.net>

	I will eventually try to merge it with the `src` subdirectory

2012-06-19  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* gdb.sh: If bdgdb exists, exec that.

2012-04-02  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* Makefile (SYSTEM_DEVELOPER_TOOLS_DOC_DIR): Update to new
	packaging location.
	(CONF_DIR, CONFIG_DIR): Stop installing anything in these
	locations.

2011-11-30  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* Makefile (CANONICAL_ARCHS): Recognize armv7s if we're asked
	to build for that arch.

2011-09-27  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	man page.  I have another verification warning if I install
	a /usr/bin binary without an accompanying man page.

2011-09-06  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* Makefile: Don't install gdb man page; we're getting a
	verification warning because we're using the old man style
	troff macros instead of mdoc and it's not worth updating the
	page to fix at this point.

2011-08-30  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* Makefile: Handle "unknown cputype/cpusubtype" for armv7s as
	temporary workaround until native tools recognize this subtype.

	* Makefile: Switch to building with clang instead of gcc.

2011-04-07  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* gdb.sh: Update script to pick the correct osabi given an
	armv6+armv7 binary when run on an armv7f system - also handle
	armv7s and armv7k systems and choose a sensible default of armv7
	if this is being run on a non-arm system instead of armv6.

2011-03-16  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* Makefile: Exclude .svn directories for the installsrc etc
	targets.

2011-03-08  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* gdb.sh: Recognize armv7f, armv7k and armv7s cpusubtypes,
	pass them as distinct osabi arguments to gdb.

2011-03-01  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* gdb.sh: Default to armv7 if the cpusubtype is not recognized.

2011-02-18  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* gdb.sh: Remove ppc support from gdb.sh.

2010-08-05  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* Makefile (TARGET_ONLY_EXTRA_ARCHS): Build the cross arm
	debugger unconditionally, eliminate TARGET_ONLY_EXTRA_ARCHS.

2009-11-18  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* Makefile:  Don't un-set MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET.

2009-07-29  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* gdb.sh: Hoist the code that inspects the core/executable file
	to get its architectures out so it is run unconditionally.
	Use lipo -info to get the list of architectures for an executable -
	this will give us more specific file architectures than just "arm",
	for instance, and we need that specificity.
	In the case of someone doing 'gdb -arch arm' on a file with only
	one arm slice, pick up the specific arm type (e.g. armv6) from the
	file and override the user's specification.

2009-07-28  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* Makefile (TARGET_ONLY_EXTRA_ARCHS): New variable that can be
	passed in -- a list of architectures that we only build cross
	debuggers for. Currently arm is the only supported configuration.
	(CROSS_TARGETS): Prune out all ppc-cross-* debuggers. Only native
	ppc will be built from now on. Folks will NOT be cross debugging
	from a  ppc system any more. 
	(CROSS_TARGETS): Prune out all arm-cross-* debuggers.  Same reason;
	only arm native and *-cross-arm debuggers are useful.
	(install-macosx): Handle the case where we are building arm cross
	debuggers but no native arm debugger.
	(dsym-and-strip-fat-gdbs): Use ARCHS_TO_INSTALL instead of 
	CANONICAL_ARCHS so we can override it up in install-macosx.
	(install-macosx): Don't install macsbug any more.

2009-07-24  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* Makefile: Remove bits that try to build gdbserver.
	(install-macosx, install): Remove conditional around calling
	install-chmod-macosx-noprocmod.

2009-07-24  Greg Clayton  <gclayton@apple.com>

	* Makefile: Fixed the standard B&I buildit build.

2009-07-17  Greg Clayton  <gclayton@apple.com>

	* Makefile: Find gcc using xcrun for cross builds and use
	-isysroot.

2009-02-03  Greg Clayton  <gclayton@apple.com>

	* Makefile: Modified installhdrs to work for cross builds and also
	fixed an issue where /private/etc/gdb.conf wasn't being generated.

2009-02-02  Greg Clayton  <gclayton@apple.com>

	* gdb.sh: Only use lipo if we have an executable and redirect
	stdout and stderr to /dev/null to omit any shell spew.

2009-01-06  Greg Clayton  <gclayton@apple.com>

	* gdb.sh: If the host arch is "arm", we check the cpusubtype so we
	can get a more descriptive arch name for HOST_ARCHITECTURE. Use
	'lipo -info' instead of the 'file' command as it returns more
	descriptive architectures.

2008-12-04  Greg Clayton  <gclayton@apple.com>

	* Makefile (cross): Modified the cross build to handle all ARM
	variants.

2008-07-02  Greg Clayton  <gclayton@apple.com>

	* Makefile: Modified the "cross" target to support building
	multiple variants into the same file.

2008-07-01  Greg Clayton  <gclayton@apple.com>

	* gdb.sh: Added armv7 as an arch that calls the correct gdb with
	the correct osabi options.
	* Makefile: Added armv7 as a potential arch.

2008-08-07  Greg Clayton  <gclayton@apple.com>

	* gdb.sh: Added armv4 and armv4t support, and let gdb auto detect
	the arm version when the arch is specified as anything that starts
	with "arm" that isn't one of "armv4", "armv4t", "armv6", or
	"armv7".

2008-07-31  Greg Clayton  <gclayton@apple.com>

	* Makefile (CANONICAL_ARCHS): Sort the items in this variable
	so check-args can have fewer permutations.
	(check-args): Recognize arm, i386 and ppc as a plausible variant
	and rely on sorted CANONICAL_ARCHS.
	(CONFIGURE_OPTIONS): Added a "filter-out" make command to remove
	extra whitespace when some settings don't have any value.
	(EFLAGS): Ditto.
	(cross): Cleaned up redundant defintions for cross_arch_full shell
	variable.

2009-06-05  Caroline Tice  <ctice@apple.com>

	* Makefile:  Add -D_DARWIN_UNLIMITED_STREAMS to CDEBUGFLAGS, to
	allow more than 256 streams to be open at a time.
	
2009-04-07  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* Makefile: Only add -Wno-error=deprecated-declarations to CFLAGS
	on specific OS releases; some compilers don't recognize the flag.

2009-02-23  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* gdb.sh: Print --help messages to stdout not stderr to match
	gdb's behavior.

2008-11-17  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* gdb.sh: Tighten up pattern matching for core files.

2008-11-06  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* Makefile (install-macosx): Call install-chmod-macosx-noprocmod
	unconditionally - build everything without setgid procmod.
	(install): Ditto.

2008-09-17  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* gdb.sh: Get the executable name of the translate binary via
	a sysctl instead of hardcoding.  Fall back on the hardcoded
	value if necessary.

2008-08-29  Greg Clayton  <gclayton@apple.com>

	* gdb.sh: Only specify an arch to gdb when we have a core file.

2008-08-29  Greg Clayton  <gclayton@apple.com>

	* gdb.sh: Only specify an arch to gdb when we need to.

2008-08-20  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* gdb.sh: Recognize the file(1) output for an x86_64 core file.
	Rename "requested_architecture" to "requested_arch" and 
	"host_architecture" to "host_arch".
	Add code, commented out currently, to tell if the current system is
	an x86_64 capable one and set host_arch to that.
	Handle cases where a host_arch of x86_64 would have caused
	problems.

2008-08-20  Greg Clayton  <gclayton@apple.com>

	* gdb.sh: Always specify an arch to gdb when the gdb binary can
	handle 32 and 64 bit variants. And fixed the code that detected
	that $GDB_ROOT was "/".

2008-08-20  Greg Clayton  <gclayton@apple.com>

	* gdb.sh: Modified the startup script to ignore all options when
	auto-detecting and launching the correct gdb, and preferring the
	core file over the executable.

2008-08-15  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* gdb.sh: Back out Greg's change for a little more refining.

2008-08-14  Greg Clayton  <gclayton@apple.com>

	* gdb.sh: Added support for auto-detecting an executable's
	architecture and launching the correct gdb.

2008-08-07  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* Makefile: This will be run with RC_ARCHS set to
	"i386 ppc x86_64" -- handle all three being specified instead if
	implicitly building x86_64.
	* template.h: Update to handle x86_64, arm.

2008-07-28  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* Makefile (CFLAGS): Add -Werror-implicit-function-declaration.

2008-07-25  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* Makefile (build-gdb): Build the cross gdb's first
	(e.g. i386 x ppc) because those are the ones that fail to build
	the most often so let us do them up front.

2008-07-25  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* Makefile: Also build an x86_64 x ppc gdb so we have got both
	binaries 3-way fat.
	Only do the installhdrs for ppc native and i386 native; not for
	each of the six gdb combos we are building now when
	-arch ppc -arch i386 is used.

2008-07-25  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* Makefile: Change up the Makefile to build x86_64 when we are
	building i386, various small changes/cleanups.

2008-06-06  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* Makefile: A few initial additions to recognize x86_64
	architecture. More changes may be needed but this gets the
	configure going.

2008-05-23  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* Makefile (CDEBUGFLAGS): Add -fasynchronous-unwind-tables.

2008-05-22  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* Makefile (CFLAGS): Add -Wno-error=deprecated-declarations so
	we do NOT get binutils failing to build because of stat64
	deprectation warnings and -Werror.

2008-05-20  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* gdb.sh: Remove the code to invoke the gdb-for-codewarrior binary.
	Update --help text.

2008-05-13  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* Makefile: No more libcheckpoint.
	* libcheckpoint/*: Removed.

2008-04-24  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* Makefile: Unset MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET when building
	an arm-native gdb on an i386/ppc system.

2008-04-23  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* gdb.sh: Issue error message if -arch command line option isn't
	followed by an architecture.

2008-03-26  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* Makefile (CDEBUGFLAGS): Add -Os back by default.

2008-03-25  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* Makefile: Do NOT make the native-arm or cross-arm gdbs
	setgid procmod.

2008-03-24  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* gdb.sh: Set OSABIOPTS when the user specifies armv6; use it when
	invoking gdb.

2007-11-07  Greg Clayton  <gclayton@apple.com>

        *Makefile: Changed CROSS_ROOT to SDKROOT for cross and crossarm
        targets.

2007-07-24  Greg Clayton  <gclayton@apple.com>

        *Makefile: CROSS_ROOT is now used to specify the SDK location
        for cross builds.

2007-06-27  Greg Clayton  <gclayton@apple.com>

        * gdb.sh: Handle arm and armv6 arch variants.
        * Makefile: Ditto.
        (CDEBUGFLAGS): Define default value only if not already defined.
        (crossarm): New target.
        (cross): New target.
        (stamp-build-gdb): Configure and build gdbserver when target 
        is arm darwin.
        (install-gdbserver): New target.
        (check-args): Add arm/armv6 darwin support.
        (install-macosx): Install gdbserver when target is arm darwin.
        
2007-12-05  Jim Ingham  <jingham@apple.com>

	* Makefile: Remove -Wno-long-double from Makefile, it is not
	supported by gcc-4.2.
	
2007-10-12  Greg Clayton  (gclayton@apple.com)

	* Makefile (GDB_RC_VERSION): Bump Leopard gdb version up to gdb-900
	to leave a hole for other gdb builds.

2007-07-10  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* Makefile (GDB_RC_VERSION): Bump Leopard gdb version up to gdb-750
	to leave a hole for Xcode 2.5 gdb submissions on the branch.

2007-05-22  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* gdb.sh: If the gdb shell script being run is a soft link to the
	actual shell script, dereference that shell script before
	determining GDB_ROOT.

2007-05-15  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* Relnotes.xml: Removed.
	* doc/Relnotes.xml: Added.
	* doc/book.xml: Added.
	* doc/gdb.gutenberg: Added.

2007-05-15  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* ReleaseNotes.xml: Add this file. It looks like we are
	responsible for maintaining it from now on so might as well have
	it under cvs.

2007-04-17  Jim Ingham  <jingham@apple.com>

	* gdb.sh: Pass the -arch argument on to gdb.

2007-03-08  Jim Ingham  <jingham@apple.com>

	* Makefile: Directly hard-code the documentation path.
	
2007-03-05  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* Makefile (check): Suppress the check makefile command echoing.

2007-03-05  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* Makefile (install-chmod-macosx): Do NOT error out if the chgrp
	procmod fails; MacsBug is NOT built for i386 so that one will
	always fail.

2007-03-05  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* Makefile (check): Print out the files that cause the copy phase
	to fail.

2007-03-05  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* Makefile (install-chmod-macosx): Do NOT check for rootness;
	assume this is being run as root. If chgrp procmod fails, indicate
	failure of the build.

2007-01-16  Jim Ingham  <jingham@apple.com>

	* gdb.sh: Call the actual gdb binary relative to
	the location of the gdb shell script, rather than
	using the absolute path.
	
2007-01-10  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* (CDEBUGFLAGS): Drop -g3 until we get macro debug info working
	a little more cleanly.

2006-12-19  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* Makefile (SYSTEM_DEVELOPER_TOOLS_DOC_DIR): Update to new doc
	location as per Hammond's e-mail of 2006-12-14.

2006-12-12  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* gdb.conf: Set the gdb history file to be left only in $HOME
	instead of $cwd (which results in .gdb_history files scattered all
	over). Remove lines listing a number of obsolete plugins so as to
	not confuse the unwary.

2006-10-25  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* Makefile (CDEBUGFLAGS): Raise the debug info level to -g3 so we
	get macro definitions included in the debug info.

2006-10-04  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* gdb.plist: New file with the Open Source Versions plist
	information for the Apple gdb sources.
	* gdb.txt: New file with a copy of gdb's copyright terms.
	* Makefile: Install them in /usr/local.

2006-07-13  Stan Shebs  <shebs@apple.com>

	* Rename libinf to libcheckpoint.
 
2006-07-13  Stan Shebs  <shebs@apple.com>

	* libinf: New directory for dylib with functions loaded
	into the inferior on demand.
	* Makefile (install-libinf): New target.
	(install-macosx): Add it.

2006-05-02  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* Makefile: Default to building with -gdwarf-2.
	(install-gdb-macosx, install-gdb-fat): Create dSYM files,
	strip the binaries that are left in SYMROOT.

2006-05-01  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* gdb.sh: Unset the DYLD_* env vars before invoking gdb;
	dyld-60 and later issue a warning when a setgid program is invoked
	and these env vars are not honored by dyld.  
	* Makefile (check): Properly quote filename check so that multiple
	matches do NOT yield a shell error.

2006-04-18  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* Makefile: Do NOT remove the symroot between phases.

2006-04-17  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* Makefile: Make installed MacsBug plugin setgid procmod.

2006-04-17  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* gdb.sh: If the parent process is "CodeWarrior", invoke
	gdb-for-codewarrior.

2006-03-10 Stacey Pang	(stacey_pang@apple.com)
	Adding some nice finishing touches on a few more files in gdb/bin
	* start_tests - now moves aside useless test directories
	* lib/TestHelper.pm - configure process has been simplified so
	  users no longer need a .dejagnurc file to make this work -
	  this should be helpful if the compiler group wants to run our
	  tests because they have their own dejagnu harness and .dejagnurc
	  files.  
	* lib/tools/ignore_tests - removed my directory so this script can
	  now be run by anyone no matter where it's installed.  
	  Note: This isn't perfect ... it still requires manually mucking
	  with the testsuite/configure script once per check-in to work.  
	  But it is the best solution at the moment.  
	* README - describes all of these things.  

2006-03-09 Stacey Pang	(stacey_pang@apple.com)
	Re-structuring gdb/bin diretory:
	- README file in gdb/bin has been updated to reflect these changes.
	- User modifiable config info and libraries are now separate from
	main testing scripts
	- Main testing scripts can now find the libaries and tools they
	need even if gdb/bin directory is relocated.  This means anyone
	should now be able to use the main testing scripts without
	modification:  
	* getInfo [-tools|-sys]        print software versions
	* mv_logs                      move log files around
	* report                       analyze and compare log files.  
	* start_tests                  create,configure test directories
				       and/or run tests.  

2006-02-21 Stacey Pang	(stacey_pang@apple.com)
	* Adding gdb/bin directory which contains several automated testing
	  scripts.  

2006-01-31  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* Makefile: Remove a bunch of unused sections of the Makefile.

2006-01-24  Stan Shebs  <shebs@apple.com>

	* Makefile (GDB_VERSION): Update.

2005-12-16  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* Makefile (CDEBUGFLAGS): Drop -mdynamic-no-pic for now; libintl
	builds in a way that requires the relocations to be present even
	though only a .a file is finally generated.

2005-12-16  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* Makefile: Remove references to mmalloc.

2005-12-16  Jim Ingham  <jingham@apple.com>

	* Makefile: Pass the GDB_RC_VERSION separately to the gdb 
	submake.
	
2005-12-01  Ronnie Misra (rgmisra@apple.com)

        * gdb.sh: Update to recognize new translate program path/command 
        line parameter.

2005-11-09  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* gdb.sh (oah750_binary): Add "-execOAH" command line parameter
	when invoking oah750 so it knows to leave our procmod setgid 
	permissions in tact.

2005-10-19  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

        * gdb.sh: Copy DYLD_* into GDB_DYLD_* to get past the setgid
        barrier.

2005-09-30  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

        * Makefile: make the gdb binaries setgid procmod.

2005-06-07  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* Makefile (GDB_RC_VERSION): Bump to 450. Tumeric will be
	in the 420-449 range.

2005-05-28  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* gdb.sh: Update --help text.

2005-05-18  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* cache-symfiles.sh: Remove.
	* Makefile: Do NOT install cache-symfiles.sh.

2005-05-03  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* gdb.sh: Add --oah750 command line option.

2005-04-14  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* gdb.sh: Add a -arch command line option.

2005-01-18  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* Makefile (GDB_VERSION): Update to the last merge.

2004-12-06  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* Info-template.plist: It looks like CFBundleDevelopmentRegion
	needs to be defined; whatever. Looking at two installed frameworks
	I see  English is an acceptable setting, so there we go. These are
	just  private framework header files used for building gdb plug-ins
	anyway.

2004-08-09  Klee Dienes  <kdienes@apple.com>

	* Makefile: Post-process the man page to refer to
	$(SYSTEM_DEVELOPER_TOOLS_DOC_DIR) instead of hard-coding (see
	change to gdb/gdb.1).

2004-06-16  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* ntbuild.sh, ntconfig.sh: Removed.
	* dpkg/control: Removed.
	* ChangeLog.binutils: Removed.

2004-06-16  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* Makefile: Do NOT install binutils, unnecessary frameworks.
	Do NOT create /usr/lib, /usr/libexec/binutils directories.

2004-06-11  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* Makefile: Quote documentation directory pathnames in case
	a space character is added.

2004-06-08  Jim Ingham  <jingham@apple.com>

        * cache-symfiles.sh: For now, do NOT emit cached symfiles
        if the original library has any stabs. gdb crashes when
        these are present (Radar 3418798)
        Also deleted the setting of "name" in the second (library)
        search, since we do NOT actually use it.
	Also, run the script far enough to delete the old symfile
	directory, since then gdb will NOT bother to look at a bunch
	of symfiles which it surely cannot use.
	
2004-06-08  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* Makefile (SYSTEM_DEVELOPER_TOOLS_DOC_DIR): Set from
	pb_makefiles' plaform-variables.make if possible. 

2004-06-07  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* Makefile: Move GDB_RC_VERSION up where I can see it.
	(SYSTEM_DEVELOPER_TOOLS_DOC_DIR): New variable to hold the location
	of the installed documentation, cf r. 3678942.
	(install-binutils-common): Do NOT install binutils docs.
	(install-binutils-macosx): Do NOT install binutils docs.
	(install-chmod-macosx): Update chmod call to avoid deprecation
	warning.

2004-05-17  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* Makefile: Bump GDB_RC_VERSION to new range.

2004-05-13  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* cached-symfiles.sh: Suppress cacheing of symfiles until Klee
	has a chance to make it work again in the newly merged sources.

2003-10-03  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

        * cache-symfiles.sh: Run nm on dylibs to ensure they are
        well-formed before feeding them to gdb.

2003-07-24  Klee Dienes <kdienes@apple.com>

	* cache-symfiles.sh: Use the proper prefix for dyld; no longer
	remove the dyld.syms from the cached symfile directory.

2003-05-04  Klee Dienes <kdienes@apple.com>

	* Makefile: Use GDB_RC_VERSION instead of APPLE_VERSION in the
	gdb.sh target. Use GDB_FRAMEWORKS and BINUTILS_FRAMEWORKS instead
	of FRAMEWORKS in the install target.

2003-05-04  Klee Dienes <kdienes@apple.com>

	* cache-symfiles.sh: Use the correct path to GDB. Do NOT read the
	user's .gdbinit. Check for dangling symlinks in /usr/lib.

	* Makefile: Do NOT chmod the dylds if you are NOT doing 
	--enable-shared.
	Also change the version string to 268.
	
2003-04-25  Klee Dienes  <kdienes@apple.com>

	* cache-symfiles.sh: Update to use the new cached-symfile
	creation commands.

2003-03-18  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* Makefile (GDB_VERSION): Updated date string to most recent
	merge.
	(CONFIG_OTHER_OPTIONS): Add --disable-serial-configure. Not
	exactly sure what is up with this, but buildit fails without
	it -- somehow configure-liberty is being triggered from the
	"configure-gdb" target and the build fails because libiberty
	is NOT included in the sources.

2003-01-14  Klee Dienes  <kdienes@apple.com>

	* Makefile: Update to use the top-level configure, and then run
	make configure-gdb. Build intl and readline for each
	cross-compiled platform, rather than re-using the native build.
	
2002-12-12  Klee Dienes  <kdienes@apple.com>

	* cache-symfiles.sh: Test each potential framework for validity,
	rather than by using an explicit list of invalid framework.
	* configure: Update to configure the needed subdirectories (they
	are no longer automatically configured by the top-level
	configure). Remove __objcInit removal code (it is removed by the
	GDB makefile).
	
2002-10-28  Klee Dienes  <kdienes@apple.com>

	* Makefile: Remove PDO support.  Convert "rhapsody" to "macosx".
	Remove obsolete Mac OS X release names.  Use *-apple-darwin
	instead of *-apple-macos10 as the primary build string.  Remove
	WITH_CFM and WITH_PTHREADS options.  Pass location for
	libintl.dylib.
	* gdb.sh: Convert *-apple-macos10 to *-apple-darwin.
	* template.h: Convert *-apple-macos10 to *-apple-darwin.  Remove
	Rhapsody support.
	* macsbug/Makefile: Convert *-apple-macos10 to *-apple-darwin.
	* macsbug/build.sh: Remove.
	
2002-09-24  Klee Dienes  <kdienes@apple.com>

	* Makefile: Update version number.
	* Makefile: Add *-macosx-darwin to the list of recognized arch
	strings.
	* Makefile: Strip trailing and leading spaces from CFLAGS.

	* template.h: include machine/sys--sys/file, not sys--sys/file.
