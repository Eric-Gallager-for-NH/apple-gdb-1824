            GDB 7.6.1 released!

Release 7.6.1 of GDB, the GNU Debugger, is now available via anonymous
FTP.  GDB is a source-level debugger for Ada, C, C++, Objective-C,
Pascal and many other languages.  GDB can target (i.e., debug programs
running on) more than a dozen different processor architectures, and GDB
itself can run on most popular GNU/Linux, Unix and Microsoft Windows
variants.

You can download GDB from the GNU FTP server in the directory:

        ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gdb

There is a web page for GDB at:

        http://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/

That page includes information about GDB mailing lists (an announcement
mailing list, developers discussion lists, etc.), details on how to
access GDB's CVS repository, locations for development snapshots,
preformatted documentation, and links to related information around
the net.  We will put errata notes and host-specific tips for this release
on-line as any problems come up.  All mailing lists archives are also
browsable via the web.

GDB 7.6 brings new targets, features and improvements, including:

  * New native configurations:

    ARM AArch64 GNU/Linux           aarch64*-*-linux-gnu
    FreeBSD/powerpc                 powerpc*-*-freebsd
    x86_64/Cygwin                   x86_64-*-cygwin*
    Tilera TILE-Gx GNU/Linux        tilegx*-*-linux-gnu

  * New target configurations:

    ARM AArch64                     aarch64*-*-elf
    ARM AArch64 GNU/Linux           aarch64*-*-linux
    Lynx 178 PowerPC                powerpc-*-lynx*178
    x86_64/Cygwin                   x86_64-*-cygwin*
    Tilera TILE-Gx GNU/Linux        tilegx*-*-linux

  * New configure options: -enable-libmcheck/--disable-libmcheck

  * Support for the "mini debuginfo" section, .gnu_debugdata

  * The C++ ABI now defaults to the GNU v3 ABI.  This has been the
    default for GCC since November 2000.

  * New command line option: -nh (disables auto-loading of ~/.gdbinit)

  * Various GDB/MI changes

  * Python scripting:

    ** Vectors can be created with gdb.Type.vector.
    ** Python's atexit.register now works in GDB.
    ** Types can be pretty-printed via a Python API.
    ** Python 3 is now supported (in addition to Python 2.4 or later)
    ** New class gdb.Architecture exposes GDB's internal representation
       of architecture in the Python API.
    ** New method Frame.architecture returns the gdb.Architecture object
       corresponding to the frame's architecture.
    ** New Python-based convenience functions ($_memeq, $_streq,
       $_strlen and $_regex)

  * The 'cd' command now defaults to using '~' (the home directory) if
    not given an argument.

  * New commands:
    ** catch signal
    ** maint info bfds
    ** python-interactive
    ** enable/disable type-printer

  * New remote packets (QTBuffer:size, Qbtrace:bts, Qbtrace:off and
    qXfer:btrace:read)

  * New options:
    ** set/show print type methods (on|off)
    ** set/show print type typedefs (on|off)
    ** set/show filename-display basename|relative|absolute
    ** set/show trace-buffer-size
    ** set/show remote trace-buffer-size-packet auto|on|off
    ** set/show debug aarch64
    ** set/show debug coff-pe-read
    ** set/show debug mach-o
    ** set/show debug notification

  * target record:

    The "target record" command has been renamed to "target record-full",
    and a new "target record-btrace" has been added.  This new target
    uses hardward support to record the control-flow of a process.
    Execution replay is not supported, but this targets allows investigating
    the program's recorded execution.
