<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>GDB version 7.0 (due September 2009) will be the first public release
of gdb to support reverse debugging (the ability to make the program 
being debugged step and continue in reverse).  See the 
<a href=http://sourceware.org/gdb/wiki/ReverseDebug>wiki page</a>
here.

<p>Presently, only certain target debugging environments will support
reverse debugging.  Those targets currently include:

<ul>
  <li> Native i386-linux ('target record')
  <li> Native amd64-linux ('target record')
  <li> Several remote targets, including:
  <ul> 
    <li> <a href=http://moxielogic.org/blog> moxie-elf simulator </a>
    <li> <a href=http://www.virtutech.com/getting_started/learn.html>
         Simics </a>
    <li> <a href=http://communities.vmware.com/community/beta/workstation>
         VMware Workstation 7.0 </a>
    <li> <a href=http://sources.redhat.com/sid> the SID simulator (xstormy16 architecture) </a>
    <li> <a href=http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~pmaydell/chronicle-gdbserver> chronicle-gdbserver using valgrind </a>
    <li> <a href=http://undo-software.com/undodb_rationale.html>UndoDB</a>
  </ul>
</ul>

<p>All of those targets, plus any additional ones in the future, will
support a common user interface for reverse debugging in gdb, including
the new commands:

<ul>
  <li> <b>reverse-continue</b> ('rc') -- Continue program being debugged but run it in reverse
  <li> <b>reverse-finish</b> -- Execute backward until just before the selected stack frame is called
  <li> <b>reverse-next</b> ('rn') -- Step program backward, proceeding through subroutine calls.
  <li> <b>reverse-nexti</b> ('rni') -- Step backward one instruction, but proceed through called subroutines.
  <li> <b>reverse-step</b> ('rs') -- Step program backward until it reaches the beginning of a previous source line
  <li> <b>reverse-stepi</b> -- Step backward exactly one instruction
  <li> <b>set exec-direction (forward/reverse)</b> -- Set direction of execution.<br>
       All subsequent execution commands (continue, step, until etc.) will run the program being debugged in the selected direction.
</ul>

<p>Breakpoints and watchpoints will work in reverse -- allowing you for 
instance to proceed directly to the previous point at which a variable
was modified.

<h3>Still to do</h3>

<p>Now that the core GDB contains support for reverse debugging, it should
be possible to add revese execution support to existing GNU simulators 
such as the ones built into GDB, as well as non-GNU targets such as
valgrind, SID, and qemu.

<p>For greater performance and fidelity in userspace and/or kernel reverse
debugging, some work on GNU/Linux as well as other open source kernels
might be done.

<p>The built-in GDB target 'Process Record / Replay' currently only supports
native reverse debugging on three platforms (i386-linux, amd64-linux, and
moxie-elf).  Volunteers are needed to extend this functionality to other
GNU/Linux platforms, and even to other operating systems.

<p>The FSF and GDB maintainers are eagerly seeking new volunteers and 
contributions in this area.  If anyone reading this is interested in
contributing to this leading edge area of research and development, 
we would welcome your help!
