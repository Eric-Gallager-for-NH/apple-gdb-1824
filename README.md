Apple-gdb-1824
==============

A fork from the gdb tarball(s) from opensource.apple.com

Build instructions:
==================

Try the top-level `./configure` script.
Or just try using `make` with the top-level Makefile, as it is **not** actually generated by the top-level `./configure` script.
Or try using `ant`.
Or try the `darwinbuild` plist.
Or try using the Xcode project in src/gdb/macosx or something.
Or if you know what the heck this tool is that Apple refers to as "`buildit`" in their Makefile commentary, you can try using that.
Most of these do not actually work, but it is always worth a shot.
