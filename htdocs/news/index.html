Changes in this release include:
<ul>
<li>GDB works with GCC -feliminate-dwarf2-dups<br>
GDB now supports a more compact representation of DWARF-2 debug
information using DW_FORM_ref_addr references.  These are produced
by GCC with the option -feliminate-dwarf2-dups and also by some
proprietary compilers.  With GCC, you must use GCC 3.3.4 or later
to use -feliminate-dwarf2-dups.
<li>Internationalization<br>
When supported by the host system, GDB will be built with
internationalization (libintl).  The task of marking up the sources is
continued, we're looking forward to our first translation.
<li>Ada<br>
Initial support for debugging programs compiled with the GNAT 
implementation of the Ada programming language has been integrated 
into GDB.  In this release, support is limited to expression evaluation.
</ul>

<dt>October 19, 2004: <b>GDB 6.3 branch created</b></dt>

<dt>September 7, 2004: <b>GDB 6.2.1 Released!</b></dt>
<dd>
<p> The latest version of GDB, version 6.2.1, is available for <a
href="../../gdb/download/">download</a>.
<p>
Changes in this update include:
<ul>
<li>Improved i386 prologue analyzer<br>
The i386 prologue analyzer was improved to deal better with the
prologues generated by GCC 3.3 and later.  As a result GDB should
produce better backtraces for code without DWARF Call Frame Info.
<li>MIPS `break main; run' gave an heuristic-fence-post warning<br>
When attempting to run even a simple program, a warning about
heuristic-fence-post being hit would be reported.  This problem has
been fixed.
<li>MIPS IRIX 'long double' crashed GDB<br>
When examining a long double variable, GDB would get a segmentation
fault.  The crash has been fixed (but GDB 6.2 cannot correctly examine
IRIX long double values).
<li>VAX and "next"<br>
A bug in the VAX stack code was causing problems with the "next"
command.  This problem has been fixed.
</ul>
Thanks goes to Mark Kettenis and Joel Brobecker for contributing fixes.

<dt>May 5, 2002: <b>Macro Support</b></dt>
<dd>
<p> Jim Blandy (<a href="http://www.redhat.com">Red Hat</a>) has added
support for C/C++ preprocessor macros to GDB.
<p> GDB can expand preprocessor macro invocations in C/C++
expressions, and provides various commands for showing macro
definitions and how they expand.
<p> Most compilers don't include information about macros in the
debugging information by default.  In GCC 3.1, for example, you need
to compile your program with the options <tt>-gdwarf-2 -g3</tt>.  If
the macro information is present in the executable, GDB will read it.
