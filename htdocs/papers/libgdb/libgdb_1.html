<H2>Function and Purpose</H2>

<P>
Libgdb is a package which provides an API to the functionality of GDB,
the GNU symbolic debugger.  It is specifically intended to support the
development of a symbolic debugger with a graphic interface.



<H2>This Document</H2>

<P>
This document is a specification of the libgdb API.  It is written in
the form of a programmer's manual.  So the goal of this document is to
explain what functions make up the API, and how they can be used in a
running application.



<H2>Terminology</H2>

<P>
In this document, <EM>libgdb</EM> refers to a library containing the
functions defined herein, <EM>application</EM> refers to any program built
with that library.



<H2>Dependencies</H2>

<P>
Programs which are linked with libgdb must be linked with libbfd,
libopcodes, libiberty, and libmmalloc.



<H2>Acknowledgments</H2>

<P>
Essential contributions to this design were made by Stu Grossman, Jim
Kingdon, and Rich Pixley.
