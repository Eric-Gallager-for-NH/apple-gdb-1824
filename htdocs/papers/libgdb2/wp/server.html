<h1>serverGDB Architecture</h1>

Jim Blandy set out a proposal for a GDB server architecture based
around a formal API.&nbsp; This propsal presents an alternative design
that addressed some of the limitations that Jim identified in Stan's
Headless GDB architecture.

<p>One of the limitations that Jim identified was:

<blockquote><i>Finally, amending GDB to produce two kinds of output
increases the complexity of the code.&nbsp; In contrast, imposing a
well-defined interface between GDB's core functionality and its user
interface reduces total complexity, by segregating the code into
separate modules with well-defined interactions.</i></blockquote>

&nbsp;while for Stan's part, he argues that:

<blockquote><i>[...] the CLI effectively defines a robust protocol -
by being text-based, encoding and byte-order issues go away, the
command processor already has error-handling built into it, and the
user manual constitutes a fairly precise specification of the
protocol's "messages".</i></blockquote>

The architecture below incorporates a design that both addresses Jim's
concern of code duplication while at the same time retaining the
flexibility of an interface based around the existing command line.

<p>This architecture breaks the rendering of data into two distinct phases:
<ol>
<li>
The GDB core which builds a description of the Reply (data).</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
The Sever which transforms reply into a form suitable for the corresponding
user interface.</li>

<br>For a CLI that would involve the simple display of the reply in textual
form.
<br>For a remote GUI, a Server implementation would serialized the Reply
(data) before transmitting it to the remote GUI.</ol>
Since the modified GDB would exploit a single set of build operations to
construct a results, Jim's concern over the need to maintain parallel code
streams each producing similar output is addressed.&nbsp; Similarly, by
initially implementing a GUI Server that serialized replies into text,
the benefits that Stan identifies would be present.
<p>Importantly, the architecture is not limited to just a CLI based server.&nbsp;
If the Server was replaced with TK/TCL, for instance, GDB would be able
to build TCL data structures directly.
<h3>
Problems and limitations</h3>
This architecture, is not with out potential limitations and risks.&nbsp;
Those immediately identifiable include:
<ul>
<li>
This architecture involves significantly more work then the alternative,
<a href="stream.html">streamGDB</a>.</li>

<br>Any perceived long term gains, must be balanced against the more immediate
need to complete the project in the time available.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Further analysis is required to confirm the feasibility of the design.</li>

<br>A prototype changing just the code known to be problematic to GDBtk
(ex. register display) is needed.</ul>
