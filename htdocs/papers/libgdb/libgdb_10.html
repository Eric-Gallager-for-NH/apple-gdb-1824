<H2><A NAME="SEC10">Setting Hooks to Execute With Debugger Commands.</A></H2>

<P>
Debugger commands support hooks.  A command hook is executed just before
the interpreter invokes the hooked command.


<P>
There are two hooks allowed for every command.  By convention, one hook
is for use by users, the other is for use by the application.


<P>
A user hook is created for a command XYZZY by using
<CODE>define-command</CODE> to create a command called <CODE>hook-XYZZY</CODE>.


<P>
An application hook is created for a command XYZZY by using
<CODE>define-command</CODE> to create a command called <CODE>apphook-XYZZY</CODE>.


<P>
Application hooks are useful for interfaces which wish to continuously
monitor certain aspects of debugger state.  The application can set a
hook on all commands that might modify the watched state.  When the hook
is executed, it can use i/o redirection to notify parts of the
application that previous data may be out of date.  After the top-level loop
resumes, the application can recompute any values that may have changed.
