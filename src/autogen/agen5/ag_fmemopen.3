.SH NAME
ag_fmemopen - Open a stream to a string
.sp 1
.SH SYNOPSIS

cc [...] -o outfile infile.c -l\fB\fP [...]
.sp 1
FILE* \fBag_fmemopen\fP( \fI\fP,  \fI\fP,  \fI\fP);
.sp 1
.SH DESCRIPTION
This function requires underlying \fBlibc\fP functionality:
either \fBfopencookie(3GNU)\fP or \fBfunopen(3BSD)\fP.

If \fBbuf\fP is \fBNULL\fP, then a buffer is allocated.  The initial
allocation is \fBlen\fP bytes.  If \fBlen\fP is less than zero, then the
buffer will be reallocated as more space is needed.  Any allocated
memory is \fBfree()\fP-ed when \fBfclose(3C)\fP is called.

If \fBbuf\fP is not \fBNULL\fP, then \fBlen\fP must not be zero.
It may still be less than zero to indicate that the buffer may
be reallocated.

The mode string is interpreted as follows.  If the first character of
the mode is:

.sp
.IR "a"
Then the string is opened in "append" mode.  In binary mode, "appending"
will begin from the end of the initial buffer.  Otherwise, appending will
start at the first NUL character in the initial buffer (or the end of the
buffer if there is no NUL character).  Do not use fixed size buffers
(negative \fBlen\fP lengths) in append mode.

.sp
.IR "w"
Then the string is opened in "write" mode.  Any initial buffer is presumed
to be empty.

.sp
.IR "r"
Then the string is opened in "read" mode.
.br

If it is not one of these three, the open fails and \fBerrno\fP is
set to \fBEINVAL\fP.  These initial characters may be followed by:

.sp
.IR "+"
The buffer is marked as updatable and both reading and writing is enabled.

.sp
.IR "b"
The I/O is marked as "binary" and a trailing NUL will not be inserted
into the buffer.  Without this mode flag, one will be inserted after the
\fBEOF\fP, if it fits.  It will fit if the buffer is extensible (the
provided \fBlen\fP was negative).  This mode flag has no effect if
the buffer is opened in read-only mode.

.sp
.IR "x"
This is ignored.
.br

Any other letters following the inital 'a', 'w' or 'r' will cause an error.
