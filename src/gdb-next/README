This folder contains outdated files from when the NeXTSTEP files were
kept separate from the rest of the gdb files. As they are outdated, they
most likely will fail to build. If you really want to try, though, you can
try to configure with the gdb directory's configure script with:
`./../gdb/configure`
(with the same flags that you would pass if you were running it in the
../gdb directory)
It should generate a Makefile which will mostly make files in ../gdb, but
occasionally it will try to make a file in this directory instead, if the
names conflict. If that happens, be prepared for errors.
