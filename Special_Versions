This file contains a list of past versions of apple-gdb which were the
last versions to contain certain files. I have tried to copy files from
these older versions into this distribution when relevant. Feel free to
add to this list if you are able to narrow down the last appearances of
other files. (This would be so much easier if Apple would just open up
their VCS to us...)

	- 309: last version with src/contrib, src/etc, src/expect, src/sim,
	src/tcl, src/texinfo, src/utils, and maybe a few other things...

	- 356: last version with a toplevel dpkg directory and toplevel
	ntbuild scripts

	- 437: last version with src/mmalloc, src/mpw*, and a few other
	things

	- 967: last version with libcheckpoint

# Versioning scheme and stuff comes from:
