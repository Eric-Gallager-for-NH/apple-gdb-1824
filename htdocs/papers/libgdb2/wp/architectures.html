<h1>
Headless GDB Architectures</h1></center>
This document will first describes the existing GDBtk architecture, identifying
a number of its limitations.
<br>It then presents two alternative architectures for GDB that address
some of the existing designs limitations.
<ul>
<li>
<a href="gdbtk.html">GDBtk</a></li>

<br>This describes how TCL/TK have been used to implement a debugger GUI
using GDB.</ul>

<h3>
New architectures</h3>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="stream.html">streamGDB</a></li>

<br>A relatively simple change to the existing GDBtk that addresses some
of the limitations.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<a href="server.html">serverGDB</a></li>

<br>A second more ambitious design that addresses the same problem.</ul>

<h3>
Conclusion</h3>
Both architectures have&nbsp; advantages and disadvantages.&nbsp; Importantly,
while they differ,, both retain Stan's recommendation that a CLI like remote
interface be provided.
<p>While the second architecture appears to be more advantageous as a longer
term change.&nbsp; It does so at considerable risk.
<p>Finally, of the factors involved in any decision process, time is probably
the one that will dominate.
