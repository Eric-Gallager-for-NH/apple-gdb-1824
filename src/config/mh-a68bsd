# None of the Apollo compilers can compile gas/binutils. The preprocessor
# chokes on bfd, the compiler will NOT let you assign ints to enums, and
# other probs. Defining CC to gcc is a questionable way to say "do NOT use
# the apollo compiler" (the preferred version of GCC could be called cc,
# or whatever), but I am not sure leaving CC as cc is any better...
