These files usually will have to be moved into place into ../.git/hooks to
actually work. Check first and see what your commit messages look like
to see if they are working properly.

FIXME: I recently added some stuff to here from:
https://gitorious.org/githooks/
The testsuite for that repo fails for me, though, so I am not actually
using them yet in the actual git hooks for this repo...
