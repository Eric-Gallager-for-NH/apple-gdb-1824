<H2><A NAME="SEC12">The Application Can Have Its Own Breakpoints</A></H2>

<P>
The GDB breakpoint commands were written with a strong presumption that
all breakpoints are managed by a human user.  Therefore, the command
language contains commands like `delete' which affect all breakpoints
without discrimination.


<P>
In libgdb, there is added support for breakpoints and watchpoints which
are set by the application and which should not be affected by ordinary,
indiscriminate commands.  These are called <EM>protected</EM> breakpoints.


<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Debugger Command:</U> <B>break-protected</B> <I>...</I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX38"></A>
<DT><U>Debugger Command:</U> <B>watch-protected</B> <I>...</I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX39"></A>
These work like <CODE>break</CODE> and <CODE>watch</CODE> except that the resulting
breakpoint is given a negative number.  Negative numbered breakpoints do
not appear in the output of <CODE>info breakpoints</CODE> but do in that of
<CODE>info all-breakpoints</CODE>.  Negative numbered breakpoints are not
affected by commands which ordinarily affect `all' breakpoints (e.g.
<CODE>delete</CODE> with no arguments).


<P>
Note that libgdb itself creates protected breakpoints, so programs
should not rely on being able to allocate particular protected
breakpoint numbers for themselves.
</DL>


<P>
More than one breakpoint may be set at a given location.  Libgdb adds
the concept of <EM>priority</EM> to breakpoints.  A priority is an integer,
assigned to each breakpoint.  When a breakpoint is reached, the
conditions of all breakpoints at the same location are evaluated in
order of ascending priority.  When breakpoint commands are executed,
they are also executed in ascending priority (until all have been
executed, an error occurs, or one set of commands continues the
target).


<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Debugger Command:</U> <B>priority</B> <I>n bplist</I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX40"></A>
Set the priority for breakpoints <VAR>bplist</VAR> to <VAR>n</VAR>.
By default, breakpoints are assigned a priority of zero.
