<h1>Using the Streaming SIMD Extensions on Linux</h1>

<p> This page provides patches that extend the Linux kernel to
support the Pentium III Streaming SIMD Extensions.

<h3>What are the Streaming SIMD Extensions?</h3>

<p> Intel's Pentium III processor contains some new instructions and
registers, known collectively as the Streaming SIMD Extensions (SSE),
which increase the Pentium III's floating-point performance.  With
the proper attention from the programmer, the Streaming SIMD
Extensions allow the Pentium III to handle floating-point-intensive
applications like video and audio handling, 3-D modeling, and
physical simulations much more quickly than its predecessors.

<h3>Why do I need to patch my kernel in order to use the Streaming
SIMD Extensions?</h3>

<p> In a multi-tasking environment, the Streaming SIMD Extensions
require support from the operating system: the SIMD registers must be
handled properly by the operating system's context switching code.
When the system switches control from one process to another, the old
process's SIMD registers must be saved away, and the saved values of
the new process's SIMD registers must be loaded into the processor.
The Pentium III processor prohibits programs from using the Streaming
SIMD Extensions unless the operating system tells the processor at
system startup time that it is aware of the SIMD registers, and will
manage them properly.

<p> The patch available on this page is based on the Pentium III patch
provided by Doug Ledford, available from his <a
href="http://people.redhat.com/dledford/linux_kernel.html"> Linux
Kernel Patch Page</a>.

<h3> What version of the Linux kernel do these patches apply to? </h3>

<p> There are two versions of the kernel patch: one for Linux 2.2.5,
and one for Linux 2.2.12.  (These are the versions distributed with
Red Hat Linux 6.0 and 6.1.)  When I wrote the patches, the basic SSE
support had not yet appeared in the experimental 2.3 kernel series, so
I was unable to produce a patch against a more recent kernel version.
However, as soon as the SSE support does appear, I will produce a new
set of patches for the debugging support.


<h2>How to use the patches</h3>

<p> There are four basic steps to applying the patches.  In summary:
<ul>
  <li> Build a kernel from the unpatched sources, and make sure it works.
  <li> Patch the kernel, configure in the SSE support, rebuild, and install.
  <li> Patch your system's header files.
  <li> Configure and build GDB.
</ul>

<p> In full detail:

<p>
<dt><b>Build a kernel from the unmodified sources, and test it.</b>

  <dd>
  <p> It is <em>essential</em> to verify that you can build a kernel
  straight from the sources, install it, and boot it up successfully,
  before you apply any patches whatsoever.  Now is also a good time to
  select the right set of drivers and modules, etc.

  <p> This is your best opportunity to distinguish between problems
  due to the patch, and problems due to the kernel configuration.  I
  had a hard time getting everything going at first, and needed help
  from someone with more experience.  The last thing you want to worry
  about here are more random external influences, like patches from
  strangers.

  <p> Red Hat Linux includes instructions for building a custom kernel
  in the Red Hat reference guide (the book you got with your
  distribution).  In the Red Hat 6.1 distribution, look at section
  2.8, ``Building a Custom Kernel''.  If you are unpacking your
  sources from an RPM, make sure to execute the RPM's <tt>%prep</tt>
  stage, to apply whatever patches are needed for your distribution.

  <p> Make sure that you are actually running the kernel you compiled.
  Put a new call to printk some place safe, like the
  <tt>calibrate_delay</tt> function in <tt>init/main.c</tt>, and
  verify that your kernel prints it out when it boots up.  (You might
  find the <tt>dmesg</tt> command helpful here.)

  <p> Make sure that you have recompiled and installed your kernel
  modules.  If the boot process hangs after it says ``Finding module
  dependencies'', one possibility is that you're trying to run your
  new kernel with your old modules.

  <p> If you ask me for help, and I find out that you haven't gotten a
  straight kernel build working before getting in touch with me, I'm
  going to be annoyed.  There are lots of people out there who have
  more experience building kernels than I do, so you should find a
  friend who knows this stuff and get their help.

<p>
<dt><b>Apply the kernel patches.</b>

<dd>
  <p> First of all, use your web browser to download the kernel patch
  to a file somewhere convenient.  There are two separate patches: one
  for version 2.2.5 of the Linux kernel:
  <br>
  <a href="jimb.linux-2.2.5-sse-ptrace-2.patch">http://sourceware.cygnus.com/gdb/papers/linux/jimb.linux-2.2.5-sse-ptrace-2.patch</a>
  <br>
  and one for version 2.2.12 of the kernel:
  <br>  
  <a href="jimb.linux-2.2.12-sse-ptrace-2.patch">http://sourceware.cygnus.com/gdb/papers/linux/jimb.linux-2.2.12-sse-ptrace-2.patch</a>
  <br>

  In these instructions, I assume you're using the 2.2.12 patch, but
  the procedure is the same for the 2.2.5 patch; only the patch's filename
  is different.  

  <p> Now, cd to the top directory of your kernel source tree --- the
  one that contains the files <tt>README.kernel-sources</tt>,
  <tt>REPORTING-BUGS</tt>, and so on.
  <pre>
  $ cd /usr/src/linux
  $ 
  </pre>

  <p> Use the <tt>patch</tt> command to apply the patch file to the
  sources, as shown here:
  <pre>
  $ patch -p0 < ~/incoming/jimb.linux-2.2.12-sse-ptrace-2.patch 
  patching file `Documentation/Configure.help'
  patching file `arch/i386/Makefile'
  patching file `arch/i386/config.in'
  patching file `arch/i386/kernel/head.S'
  patching file `arch/i386/kernel/i386_ksyms.c'
  patching file `arch/i386/kernel/process.c'
  patching file `arch/i386/kernel/ptrace.c'
  patching file `arch/i386/kernel/setup.c'
  patching file `arch/i386/kernel/signal.c'

  patching file `include/asm-i386/uaccess.h'
  patching file `include/linux/elf.h'
  $ 
  </pre>

<p>
<dt><b>Configure the kernel to enable the SSE support.</b>

<dd>
  <p> There are several different ways to configure a Linux kernel;
  these are generic instructions, which should work for any of the
  configuration methods.
  
  <p> In the category ``Processor type and features'':

    <ul>

      <li> Select a CPU type of ``PPro/6x86MX/PII'' or
      ``PIII/Xeon/Deschutes''.

      <li> Select ``Enable PII/PIII Extended/Fast CPU save and restore
      support''.

      <li> Select ``Enable PIII Streaming XMM operations''.

    </ul>

  <p> Leave the rest of the configuration the way it was for your
  previous working build.  (You do have a previous working build, don't
  you?)

<p>
<dt><b>Build your patched kernel.</b>

<dd>
  <p> Use the same process here you did for your previous working build.

<p>
<dt><b>Install your kernel.</b>

<dd>

  <p> As before, make sure you have built and installed fresh modules,
  to go along with your kernel.  Trying to use old modules with a new
  kernel doesn't work too well.  If your kernel hangs while booting,
  after saying ``Finding module dependencies'', then you may not have
  installed your new modules the way you expected.

  <p> Make sure to leave a kernel you know is useable in your
  <tt>/etc/lilo.conf</tt> file, so if things blow up, you have
  something to fall back to.  Once you've got it working, however, you
  can make your new kernel the default; see the <tt>lilo.conf(5)</tt>
  for more info here.

<p>
<dt><b>Reboot, using the new kernel.</b>

<dd>

  <p> When the <tt>lilo:</tt> prompt appears during the boot process,
  type the name you gave your patched kernel in <tt>/etc/lilo.conf</tt>.

<p>
<dt><b>Verify that your kernel supports the Streaming SIMD Extensions</b>

<dd>

  <p> The file <tt>/proc/cpuinfo</tt> contains a list of the
  CPU-related options you selected when you configured the kernel.  If
  the Streaming SIMD Extensions support is enabled, the line labeled
  <tt>flags:</tt> should contain the words <tt>fxsr</tt> and
  <tt>xmm</tt>, usually at the end.  For example:

  <pre>
  $ cat /proc/cpuinfo
  processor       : 0
  vendor_id       : GenuineIntel
  cpu family      : 6
  model           : 7
  model name      : Pentium III (Katmai)
  stepping        : 2
  cpu MHz         : 497.440714
  cache size      : 512 KB
  fdiv_bug        : no
  hlt_bug         : no
  sep_bug         : no
  f00f_bug        : no
  coma_bug        : no
  fpu             : yes
  fpu_exception   : yes
  cpuid level     : 2
  wp              : yes
  flags           : fpu vme de pse tsc msr pae mce cx8 sep mtrr pge mca cmov pat pse36 mmx fxsr xmm
  bogomips        : 496.44

  $ 
  </pre>

<p>
<dt><b>Patch your header files.</b>

<dd>

  <p> Among other things, the kernel patch extends some system calls to
  give the debugger access to processes' SIMD registers.  However, we
  need to extend the user-side descriptions of these system calls to
  include the new functionality.

  <p> So, use your web browser to download the header file patch to
  somewhere convenient.  In these instructions, I assume you're
  using the same filename I did: <tt>jimb.glibc-sse-ptrace.patch</tt>.

  <p> The URL for the patch is <a href="jimb.glibc-sse-ptrace.patch">http://sourceware.cygnus.com/gdb/papers/linux/jimb.glibc-sse-ptrace.patch</a>.

  <p> Now, cd to <tt>/usr/include/sys</tt> --- the directory
  containing <tt>ptrace.h</tt> and <tt>user.h</tt>.

  <p> These files are not usually world-writeable, so, as root, use
  the <tt>patch</tt> command to apply the patch file to the sources,
  as shown here:
  <pre>
  $ cd /usr/include/sys
  $ su
  Password: 
  [root@zenia sys]# patch -p0 < ~jimb/incoming/jimb.glibc-sse-ptrace.patch 
  patching file `ptrace.h'
  patching file `user.h'
  [root@zenia sys]# exit
  $ 
  </pre>

  <p> You don't need to rebuild your kernel after applying this patch.
  It's only interesting to debuggers.

<p>
<dt><b>Make sure you have the right sources for GDB.</b>

<dd>

  <p> We added support for the Streaming SIMD Extensions to GDB rather
  recently.  To verify that your GDB sources contain this support,
  look in <tt>gdb/ChangeLog</tt>.  There should be an entry no earlier
  than November 1999 containing the text:

  <pre>
	Add support for SSE registers in core files.
	* corelow.c (get_core_register_section): New function.
  </pre>

  <p> If the file contains these comments, then your GDB sources should
  support the Streaming SIMD Extensions.

<p>
<dt><b>Configure and build GDB.</b>

<dd>

  <p> GDB's configuration process checks your system's header files to
  see whether your system has been extended to support the Streaming
  SIMD Extensions.  So, you must configure GDB after patching your
  header files.  Follow the instructions in the README file at the top
  of the source tree, or the instructions you received from Cygnus.

<p>
<dt><b>Verify that your GDB has been built properly.</b>

<dd>

  <p> Start up the GDB you just built, and try to print the value of
  the SIMD register <tt>$xmm0</tt>.  Since you're not actually
  debugging a program, GDB doesn't have any value to display for that
  register, but it should at least recognize that it is a register name:

  <pre>
  $ /umbra/jimb/build/gdb/gdb -nw 
  GNU gdb 4.18-PentiumIII-991112
  Copyright 1998 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
  GDB is free software, covered by the GNU General Public License, and you are
  welcome to change it and/or distribute copies of it under certain conditions.
  Type "show copying" to see the conditions.  This version of GDB is supported
  for customers of Cygnus Solutions.  Type "show warranty" for details.
  This GDB was configured as "i686-pc-linux-gnu".
  (gdb) print $xmm0
  No registers.
  (gdb) print $foo
  $1 = void
  (gdb) 
  </pre>

  <p> As you can see, this GDB says that an undefined convenience variable
  is <tt>void</tt>, but recognizes that <tt>$xmm0</tt> is the name of
  a register.

  <p> Of course, the final test is to try to debug a program that uses
  the Streaming SIMD Extensions, either at the source level using the
  Intel intrinsics interface, or at the assembly language level.
