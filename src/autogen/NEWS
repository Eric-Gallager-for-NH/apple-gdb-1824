* getopt support has been improved.  Developers using generated code
  that called that function had to arrange for the autoopts/option.h
  header to be available.  That text is now inserted into the code.

* dependency tracking improvements.  renaming an output file confused
  the code and licensing files were not listed.

* libopts did not provide the full executable path name in pzProgPath
  if it was not supplied in argv[0].  "pathfind(3GEN)" is now used
  in that case.

* makefile-script function will now honor the "then", "else" and "in"
  keywords appearing at the end of a line.  "makefile-script" splices
  lines together with a semi-colon and a backslash, add a leading tab
  to each line and double dollar sign characters, basically turning
  semi-ordinary shell scripts into scripts suitable for use with make.
  In the case of these keywords and certain operators, the semi-colon
  is now omitted.

  Additionally, it produces text that can be post-processed at
  configure time in that it will leave alone any lines starting with
  "@ifdef", "@ifndef", "@else" and "@endif".  See the second argument
  to the AC_CONFIG_FILES() autoconf macro for details.

* AutoOpts now uses string tables instead of individual static char const's.

* AutoOpts now supports vendor-opt attribute to auto-implement the "-W"
  option for POSIX specified utilities

New in 5.11.6 February 2011

* packaging information
  The PKGDATADIR and --with-packager... information are now
  compiled into the option structure.
